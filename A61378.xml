            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS the juſt meaſure of the</hi> truth <hi>of all</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Aſſertions, <hi>is to be taken from their</hi> conſonancy <hi>to the word of God: So the</hi> uſefulneſs <hi>and</hi> profit <hi>of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of that nature is to be eſtimated by the</hi> ſeaſonableneſs <hi>and</hi> ſubſerviency <hi>thereof to the grand Deſignes of the</hi> Goſpel. <hi>In both which reſpects the</hi> following Treatiſe, <hi>however attended with many imperfections, may for the</hi> ſubſtance <hi>and</hi> ſcope <hi>of it,</hi> make Appeal <hi>to the judgments of ſuch as are really touched with the</hi> concernes of Religion; <hi>and have their</hi> ſenſes exerciſed <hi>to diſcern wherein it's</hi> intereſt <hi>lieth, and how the</hi> progreſs <hi>of it is retarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The great</hi> Intendments <hi>of the Goſpel, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and furtherance whereof all</hi> particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts <hi>ſhould be ſubordinated, are moſtly reducible to</hi> three heads. <hi>The</hi> illuſtration <hi>and magnifying of the</hi> Grace of God, <hi>in the ſalvation of loſt ſinners. The</hi> Exaltation <hi>and advancement of</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the only Mediatour of the Covenant of Grace. The</hi> vindication <hi>and promoting of</hi> real holineſs and purity, <hi>amongſt the children of men. And the drift and purport of the</hi> Tract enſuing <hi>more directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the</hi> laſt <hi>of theſe: To</hi> miniſter help <hi>in the
<pb facs="tcp:106335:3"/>following after</hi> Godlineſs, <hi>and to remove out of the way the</hi> main impediments, <hi>that hinder from an</hi> hearty cloſure <hi>therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a point as clear as the</hi> Noon-day, <hi>and cannot be denyed by ſuch as own the Scriptures, that a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cordial proſecution of</hi> holineſs <hi>in the greateſt</hi> ſtrictneſs <hi>and</hi> heighth <hi>of it, is of</hi> indiſpenſeable neceſſity <hi>to the</hi> Beatifical viſion, <hi>and</hi> enjoyment <hi>of God. Without which, all</hi> profeſſions of faith <hi>and</hi> love <hi>to God are but</hi> empty names, <hi>and</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits; <hi>indeed,</hi> a meer mockery of the moſt High. <hi>How ſhall any be induced to believe, that a man doth unfeignedly</hi> embrace <hi>and</hi> love <hi>the</hi> principles, <hi>by which he refuſeth</hi> to ſteer his courſe? <hi>Or that ſuch</hi> divine truths <hi>have a real ſeat in his</hi> affections, <hi>which are openly diſavowed and contradicted in his</hi> converſation. <hi>He that will give a ſolid</hi> teſtimony <hi>of his ſincere</hi> reſpects <hi>to the doctrine of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>muſt do it by a</hi> demeanour <hi>anſwerable thereunto. It is by upright and humble walking as in the ſight of God, that</hi> Religion <hi>muſt be</hi> adorned, <hi>that it may</hi> attract <hi>the hearts of them that are</hi> without: <hi>Hereby our</hi> profeſſion <hi>muſt be</hi> juſtified, <hi>both in the</hi> ſight of men <hi>and to the approbation of our own</hi> conſciences: <hi>And in this way alone, we can comfortably expect to be conducted with ſafety to the</hi> Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the</hi> nature <hi>and</hi> excellency of holineſs <hi>and the fear of the Lord, are conſidered</hi> ſeparately, <hi>in themſelves, without reflection upon the</hi> quality of the perſons <hi>preſſed thereunto, it may ſeem a needleſs task, to ſpend</hi> much time, <hi>or</hi> many words, <hi>in defence of it.</hi> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations! for unto thee it doth appertain? <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Who,
<pb facs="tcp:106335:3"/>that has any ſpark of</hi> ſound wiſdom, <hi>would not be found faithful, in the</hi> covenant <hi>of God? Who, that hath an</hi> inſight <hi>into the</hi> beauty of holineſs, <hi>would not</hi> admire <hi>and</hi> fall in love, <hi>with it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuch is the</hi> enmity <hi>radicated in mens hearts, againſt the Lord, and their</hi> perverſe diſputings <hi>againſt the purity of the wayes of God; and their</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictedneſs <hi>to conform unto</hi> this world; <hi>that it is rather</hi> a wonder of free grace, <hi>that any perſons are prevailed upon, to cloſe effectually with the power of Godlineſs; than that it ſhould be confined within ſo</hi> narrow a compaſs, <hi>as the experience</hi> of all ages, <hi>too abundantly manifeſteth it to be.</hi> Beſides, <hi>it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no difficult obſervation, to a</hi> thoughtful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>who hath his eyes open, and is in the leaſt degree</hi> akin <hi>to the children of</hi> Iſſachar, <hi>that</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the times, <hi>what have been the crafty</hi> machinations <hi>and</hi> methods <hi>of the Devil, and his adherents, in theſe</hi> late dayes, <hi>to bring the</hi> ſtrictneſs of Religion <hi>into contempt, and to make it a reproach; by caſting</hi> loads <hi>of</hi> accuſations <hi>upon the profeſſours thereof: that ſo</hi> Godlineſs <hi>may be wounded through their</hi> loynes, <hi>and the ſpirits of men deterred, and diſcouraged from the ſedulous purſuance of it. And what if the</hi> miſcarriages <hi>and</hi> extravagancies <hi>of ſome who ſeemed to be</hi> eminent for piety, <hi>have miniſtred too much occaſion to them, that lye at the</hi> catch, <hi>to raiſe an</hi> evil report, <hi>and to vent their</hi> ſlanderous revilings <hi>againſt the truth? Yet it muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be but a very</hi> ridiculous piece of Logick, <hi>to argue from the</hi> corruption <hi>of ſome, to the</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>of all. As if</hi> all ſorts <hi>of money were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in payment, becauſe</hi> ſome pieces <hi>are but</hi> braſs ſilvered over: <hi>eſpecially ſeeing it is none other, than
<pb facs="tcp:106335:4"/>what the ſpirit of God hath plainly intimated,</hi> that there will be tares mingled with the wheat untill the harveſt: <hi>There will be</hi> hypocrites <hi>and</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers <hi>in outward fellowſhip with the</hi> Saints, <hi>even unto the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>However, from hence ariſeth a neceſſity of</hi> Pleas, Apologies, <hi>and</hi> vindications <hi>to wipe off the</hi> ſlurres <hi>and</hi> calumnies, <hi>which men of</hi> profligate principles <hi>and</hi> ſeared conſciences <hi>are wont to caſt on the face of religion: And a like neceſſity of</hi> arguments <hi>and</hi> provocatives <hi>to quicken men to follow after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: and of</hi> anſwers <hi>to be returned to the</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſonings, <hi>whereby they</hi> cavil <hi>againſt the</hi> truth; <hi>and ſtudy to evade the</hi> convictions <hi>that are ſometimes wrought upon their ſpirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the</hi> Meditations <hi>here commended to thy</hi> candid <hi>and</hi> ſerious peruſal, <hi>may contribute aſſiſtance to this purpoſe; that any of the</hi> Truths <hi>that are according to Godlineſs may be</hi> cleared up; <hi>The</hi> prejudices <hi>and</hi> ſtumbling blocks <hi>removed out of the way of ſalvation; ſuch as are</hi> declining <hi>may be</hi> recalled, <hi>and thoſe that are</hi> ſound in the faith <hi>further</hi> ſettled <hi>and</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; <hi>the</hi> Author <hi>hath attained his end; and let all the</hi> glory <hi>be aſcribed unto</hi> God. <hi>To whom doth moſt deſervedly appertain,</hi> All honour, and praiſe, love, ſubmiſſion, and ſervice, in the Church, by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Which words</hi> have an entire ſenſe <hi>in themſelves,</hi> and hold forth a perfect leſſon, or inſtruction <hi>of themſelves:</hi> and therefore we ſhall not need to ſpend time, in ſearching into the <hi>relation</hi> which they bear, unto any <hi>precedent</hi> paſſages of this book. Only thus much <hi>in the general:</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> ſeemeth to come in, as a word of <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>advice,</hi> what <hi>courſe</hi> we muſt take and what <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection</hi> we ſhould uſe, that we may live up to the Precepts of God, and not be carried away from the obſervance of his commandments. <hi>Why,</hi> to this end we muſt diligently ſee to it, that we be not ſwayed and over-ruled by the <hi>example of others,</hi> be they never ſo many. In this and the former chapter we have a <hi>ſolemn promulgation of the divine laws,</hi> by which the Lord would have his people to be guided: and the <hi>Text</hi> is introduced as a <hi>ſerious caution,</hi> to warn us to ſtick cloſe to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106335:10"/>thoſe laws; though others reject them, and trample them under foot. Although a <hi>multitude</hi> forſake them, yet muſt not we: that will not bear us out in any ſin whatſoever. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may open this portion of <hi>Divine writ,</hi> more <hi>clearly</hi> and methodically: let us take it aſunder into 3 <hi>parts.</hi> Here is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The end intended:</hi> or <hi>the deſign, that's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by this counſel:</hi> and that is to preſerve us from evil. <hi>[Thou ſhalt not do evil]</hi> 1. <hi>Primarily,</hi> it is to preſerve us from the <hi>evil of ſin</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. 2. <hi>Conſequentially</hi> to keep us from the <hi>evil of affliction</hi> and judgment, which is deſerved by <hi>Sin:</hi> and which God is uſually provoked to inflict upon <hi>ſinners.</hi> If we would eſcape the evil of <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow;</hi> we muſt carefully avoid the evil of <hi>iniquity,</hi> and diſobedience. <hi>Thou ſhalt not do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The direction preſcribed, in order to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that end. Why,</hi> to this purpoſe you muſt take heed, that you be not led by the multitude. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi> Thou ſhalt not follow them] It is a <hi>comprehenſive</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not be after them.</hi> It may reach to theſe 3. <hi>things.</hi> 1. Thou ſhalt not follow them, <hi>in point of inclination.</hi> Thy heart ſhall not hanker after their wayes: thou ſhalt not deſire to joyn with them in any wickedneſs. This is <hi>to follow a thing,</hi> in the dialect of the Scripture, when the affections are touched with any propenſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106335:11"/>it. As the <hi>underſtanding is the eye of the Soul,</hi> whereby we diſcern or ſee into an object, ſo the <hi>will and affections are the feet of the Soul,</hi> whereby it goes out unto it, or follows after it. So that it imports thus much, thou ſhalt not ſo much as have any <hi>liking,</hi> or the leaſt <hi>inclination</hi> in thy Spirit, to be of their ſociety and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. 2. Thou ſhalt not follow them, <hi>in reſpect of incouragement, q. d.</hi> This ſhall not <hi>imbolden</hi> thee to ſin againſt God, becauſe thou ſeeſt many others to ſin againſt him. What people are afraid to venture upon <hi>ſingly</hi> and <hi>by themſelves;</hi> they will be <hi>animated</hi> unto, by obſerving others to go before them. But let it not be ſo, <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> in the caſe of Sin; though you ſee never ſo many go before you. 3. Thou ſhalt not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, <hi>in point of actual concurrence.</hi> You muſt not <hi>tread in their ſteps,</hi> if it be a ſinful way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they travel. You muſt not take your pattern, from their practiſe: nor act according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their actions, if they be evil. This I take to be <hi>principally</hi> meant, and the other in reference hereunto. Thus you read of thoſe carnal wretches, <hi>They followed the way of Balaam, i. e.</hi> Their carriage was correſpondent to his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and their hearts went after covetouſneſs, even as his, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. And it is mentioned of <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehu, that he followed the ſins of Jeroboam,</hi> that is, he carried on the ſame carnal intereſt, and committed the ſame abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, This is the <hi>ſecond thing</hi> to be noted in the <hi>Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We have obſervable, <hi>the manner of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing this rule of direction: how the caution is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106335:11"/>delivered, as to this matter.</hi> And that is,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>prohibition</hi> is laid down <hi>ſingularly,</hi> or <hi>perſonally. Thou</hi>] that it might extend to all ſorts of people, without exception of any: that every one of us might take it home to our ſelves, and apply it to our own ſouls: that none might think himſelf exempted from the obligatory power of this prohibition. As the prophet <hi>Malachi:</hi> ſpeaks unto the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> cap. 2.1. <hi>This commandment is for you.</hi> The like may I ſay, in this caſe, to men of all ranks and qualities. <hi>Art thou a maſter, or governour?</hi> This precept is for thee. <hi>Art thou a child, or ſervant?</hi> This prohibition reacheth thee. <hi>Art thou a Magiſtrate, or a ſubject? young, or old? rich, or poor? Jew, or Gentile?</hi> whatever thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, thou art included herein. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is delivered <hi>negatively.</hi> It is one of thoſe precepts which are uſually called <hi>negative precepts:</hi> That it might be of a binding force as <hi>to all times</hi> and <hi>ſeaſons.</hi> Herein is a ſpecial difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative</hi> precepts. The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative commandments <hi>always bind,</hi> but not <hi>to all times.</hi> For inſtance, <hi>Hear the word: Search the Scriptures: Give alms of thy Goods.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like injunctions, <hi>always bind,</hi> but not <hi>to all times</hi> and <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> i. e. I am not obliged to be every moment of my life, in the actual diſcharge of thoſe duties. But <hi>negative precepts</hi> bind <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</hi> and <hi>unlimitedly,</hi> to all times and ſeaſons, <hi>ex. gr. Lye not one to another. Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</hi> There is no time of a mans life, wherein theſe may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106335:12"/>done. And ſuch a precept is this of <hi>not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the multitude.</hi> Sinners are apt to think, they muſt ſtrictly walk up to ſuch <hi>rules,</hi> whilſt they may be obſerved with ſafety: But <hi>in peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times</hi> they muſt be excuſed; when it may coſt them their <hi>livelyhoods,</hi> or their <hi>lives,</hi> if they ſtep out of the common road. <hi>Nay,</hi> but you muſt never take the liberty to break the bounds of this law: you muſt ſee to it that, at <hi>no time,</hi> you ſay <hi>a confederacy</hi> with the <hi>multitude,</hi> in ſin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Text</hi> being thus <hi>explained,</hi> will affourd us this <hi>practical leſſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That in order to our keeping cloſe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord, and for the right ordering our converſations in the preſence of the Lord; we muſt take heed to our ſelves, that at no time whatſoever we follow a multitude to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt not ſin againſt God, though we ſee <hi>never ſo many</hi> go on in ſin before our faces. We muſt ſtick faſt to Gods teſtimonies, and do only what is acceptable in his ſight, though we have very few to bear us company: though we are forced to go alone in the ways of holineſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend. Iſrael</hi> was the greateſt body of the people; it contained ten of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> whereas the kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> conſiſted but of two. Why but, <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> though they are a very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous company, that have fallen off to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and your ſelves are but an handful <hi>in compariſon;</hi> yet you muſt not give ground, becauſe of their <hi>multitude:</hi> though you have the 10. <hi>Tribes</hi> to lead you the way in iniquity, yet you muſt not be led by their example. This was the doctrine in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106335:12"/>which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was inſtructed <hi>with a mighty hand;</hi> intimating that it is a difficult point to be learnt, and a matter of great concernment: If we will be the ſervants of God in truth, we muſt learn this Leſſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>For the Lord ſpake thus to me with a ſtrong hand, and inſtructed me, that I ſhould not walk in the way of this people, ſaying, ſay ye not</hi> a confederacy <hi>to all them, to whom this people ſhall ſay,</hi> a confederacy: <hi>neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid;</hi> q. d. Though the whole people combine together to do wickedneſs, caſt not in thy lot amongſt them: keep thy ſelf far from their <hi>combination.</hi> Dare not to tread in their ſteps, nor joyn in their <hi>aſſociation,</hi> be they never ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a company: keep thy ſelf free from their <hi>confederacy,</hi> and fear the Name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>For the handling of this Point, <hi>as a Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt infection by the practiſe of the multitude,</hi> I ſhall <hi>lightly</hi> paſs over <hi>four Heads of enquiry</hi> in the doctrinal part of our <hi>diſcourſe;</hi> and then cloſe up all, with <hi>a practical improvement</hi> of the whole.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. <hi>This caution, that is laid down here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doing of evil</hi> (for the extent of it, how far it reacheth) <hi>may be well taken in the greateſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and comprehenſiveneſs of the expreſſion: as it ſets againſt all ſorts, and kinds, and qualities of ſin whatſoever.</hi> Whether they are <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>leſſer;</hi> ſins of <hi>omiſſion,</hi> or <hi>commiſſion;</hi> againſt the <hi>firſt</hi> table of the Law, or the <hi>ſecond:</hi> Whether they are ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of the mind, or inordinate paſſions working in the heart and ſpirit; whether it be rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten communication that proceedeth out of the mouth, or any manner of diſorderlineſs in the outward behaviour, and carriage.</p>
               <p>A mans actions or doings, <hi>in a reſtrained ſenſe,</hi> are ſometimes contradiſtinguiſhed, and oppoſed to his words, and thoughts, and affections, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. <hi>In word, or deed.</hi> Jam. 2.12. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do.</hi> But in this place you may take it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>limitation,</hi> or <hi>reſtriction:</hi> for it is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>indefinitely,</hi> and without exception. It may poſſibly have a ſpecial reference to the ſin of <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106335:13"/>falſe witneſs,</hi> (as ſome think) which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned immediately before the Text; or to the ſin of <hi>wreſting judgment</hi> (according to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of others) being the ſin which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the words following the Text: But it ought not to be confined to either. As, where the holy Ghoſt hath not diſtinguiſhed, we muſt not diſtinguiſh: ſo where the Spirit of God hath not ſet reſtrictions and limits, we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain. <hi>Beſides,</hi> The original word is in the plural. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ad mala,</hi> to evils, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to any ſort of evil. So that the meaning may be this. Thou ſhalt not joyn with a multitude, in their plots and contrivances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wayes of God. Thou ſhalt not talk vainly, and frothily, or in any wicked manner, as they ſpeak. You muſt not act in any thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pattern and ſimilitude of their ſinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But in every thing keep your ſelves pure, and unſpotted, from the taint of their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. <hi>This doing of evil</hi> (for the nature of it, wherein it conſiſts) <hi>is a breaking of the Law of God, or walking contrary to the dictates of his revealed will, which he hath given as the rule for the guidance of our ſteps.</hi> It is the neglecting of any thing, which God hath injoyned to be performed; or the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which he hath forbidden to be done. Herein lies the <hi>ratio formalis,</hi> or the nature of ſin, that <hi>it is a want of conformity to the Law of God,</hi> or <hi>a tranſgreſſion of it,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4.

               <p>It is the moſt <hi>poyſonous</hi> and <hi>venemous thing</hi> in the world: the moſt <hi>miſchievous thing</hi> under the Sun.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106335:14"/>God doth awaken the conſcience, or begin to take the work of judgment into his hands, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall be forced to acknowledge it to be ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. <hi>Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Wherefore commit ye this great evil againſt your ſouls?

We reckon <hi>poverty</hi> in the eſtate, and <hi>ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of body, and <hi>outward diſaſters</hi> and <hi>calamities,</hi> to be the main evils: But, <hi>alas,</hi> they are nothing, if laid in the ballance with ſin.

To commit ſin is to do evil; <hi>For that is the fountain evil: the original and well-ſpring of all other evils whatſoever.</hi> It is the evil of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that brings affliction upon mens <hi>perſons,</hi> and a curſe into their <hi>families</hi> and <hi>eſtates,</hi> and puts va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation into their <hi>creature-comforts,</hi> and <hi>accommodations.</hi> It is ſin that lets in wars and commotions into <hi>kingdoms,</hi> and burns up <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities;</hi> and makes a <hi>Land</hi> deſolate, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fruitful place into barrenneſs.

For the original of it, whence it doth proceed: <hi>All the evils which are done in the life of a ſinner, proceed from within out of the heart, and flow from the native pravity and corruption of the Spirit.</hi> When a perſon walketh in any ſinful courſe, he doth but, <hi>as the ſpider,</hi> weave a curſed web out of his own poyſonous bowels. At the firſt, <hi>mans ſinful and irregular actions did corrupt his nature;</hi> and now, <hi>our polluted nature doth tranſmit defilement into our actions.</hi> We are not forced and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106335:16"/>compelled unto the practiſe of evil, but our hearts encline and carry us thereunto, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.21.22. <hi>For from within out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laſciviouſneſs, an evil eye, blaſphemy, pride, fooliſhneſs: all theſe evils come from within.</hi> This is a point of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſtudied, and effectually preſſed upon the conſcience. (1) <hi>That it may work in us an holy ſhame, and ſelf abhorrence in reſpect of actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions;</hi> and we may be induced to loath our ſelves in our own ſight. For <hi>my brethren,</hi> a perſon will never be throughly humbled for the ſins of his life, till he hath learnt to trace them unto his heart, and ſeeth them to be ſtreams iſſuing out of that ſink of filth and folly that is within him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.21, 22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. (2) <hi>That it may leave full convictions upon our ſpirits, of the abſolute neceſſity of ſanctifying and regenerating grace:</hi> that our natures muſt be changed, and our very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits within us muſt be purified, in order to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, and that we may be fitted for his ſervice; becauſe the principal ſeat of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is within, and all inordinate motions in the practiſe are but rivulets flowing from that troubled ſea, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5, 6, 7, 10. (3) <hi>That it may prevail upon us, to keep a continual eye of ſuſpition and jealouſy upon our hearts,</hi> and to be in a conſtant poſture of watchfulneſs over them, leaſt they ſhould carry us aſide. For <hi>he that truſteth in his own heart, is a fool. Prov.</hi> 28.26. <hi>i. e.</hi> He is groſlly deluded, and miſtaken, in the internal <hi>diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>bent</hi> of his own ſpirit.

(4) Again, this is a point to be throughly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and conſidered, <hi>that we may not hearken to thoſe vain excuſes, whereby we are apt to cover our ſins, and to tranſlate the guilt from off our ſelves.</hi> There is a proneſs in ſinners, to lay the blame of their miſcarriages upon any thing, rather then upon themſelves; and they are hardly wrought to an ingenious acknowledgment of their evil doings: but they have ever ſomething to plead in their own vindication, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their innocency. <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat,</hi> Gen. 3.12. <hi>The ſerpent beguiled me, and I did eat,</hi> v. 13. <hi>I ſaw the people were ſcattered from me, and that thou cameſt not within the dayes appointed, and that the Philiſtines gathered themſelves together to Michmaſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I forced my ſelf therefore, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a burnt offering,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.11, 12. <hi>We have ſpared of the beſt of the ſheep and of the oxen, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto the Lord thy God,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.15. Such <hi>evaſions</hi> men have to avoid conviction: and ſuch <hi>pretences</hi> they plead, to colour over their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; and to put a <hi>fair gloſs</hi> upon their iniquities. God knows my heart is good, <hi>will a carnal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſay,</hi> but the Devil owed me a ſpite, and he drove me on to this practiſe. I am neceſſitated, <hi>ſaith another,</hi> to take this courſe. I am in a mean
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106335:17"/>eſtate and have a multitude of buſineſs on my hands, and have no time to ſpare to mind reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and converſe with God; But I mean well, and my heart is for God. Thus <hi>they dig deep, to hide their wickedneſs;</hi> and ſtand up in defence of the integrity of their hearts, whetever their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations have been: Whereas Sirs all evil cometh out of the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treaſure, bringeth forth evil things.</hi> So that, <hi>Let no man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God,</hi> i. e.

Let them not ſay, <hi>The Lord made me thus;</hi> it was <hi>my fate</hi> and <hi>deſtiny,</hi> and I could not withſtand what he had appointed me to. Let them not ſay, <hi>that God doth neceſſitate them to ſin.</hi> Let them not lay the fault upon the <hi>condition of life</hi> wherein God hath placed them, or upon the <hi>providences</hi> under which he doth exerciſe them. For all ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from within out of the heart. <hi>For God cannot be tempted with ſin, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt, and enticed,</hi> Jam. 1.13, 14. Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>from without</hi> can do nothing, except there were <hi>Luſt within,</hi> to ſwallow the bait, and to give entertainment to the allurements of the world, and ſollicitations of the devil.</p>
               <p>Concl. 5. <hi>Although the internal and inbred cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and wickedneſs of the heart of a ſinner, is the ſeedplot of evil, whence it doth ſpring up; yet outward occaſions and provocatives, have commonly a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the educing of that corruption into exerciſe,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106335:18"/>and to the actual production of that which is evil.</hi> From thence it is that the heart of a man, which is full of ſin, is <hi>irritated</hi> and <hi>emboldened</hi> to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin. Theſe are the <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> which Satan doth make uſe of, to <hi>inſtigate</hi> and <hi>ſtir up</hi> the children of men, to acts of wickedneſs; and to <hi>incite</hi> and <hi>incourage</hi> them in a way that is not good. <hi>As now for inſtance,</hi> when ſinners abuſe the <hi>patience of God,</hi> to ſtrengthen their hands in a courſe of ungodlineſs; <hi>It is the heart of the ſons of men that is ſet to do evil;</hi> and the forbearance and long-ſuffering of God that is made uſe of for an <hi>incouragement</hi> unto the doing of it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.11. When perſons defile themſelves with ſin, <hi>that they may avoid trouble and perſecution;</hi> it is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heart, that doth lead them unto ſin, and is the <hi>agent</hi> in ſin; and it is <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> and the <hi>advancement of a carnal intereſt,</hi> which helps to draw forth that corruption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12. And herein doth appear the deſperate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and malignity of mans heart: As it is <hi>full of evil,</hi> and <hi>of a curſed forwardneſs unto evil;</hi> ſo it is <hi>apt to pervert all ſorts of providences thereunto.</hi> A ſinner, <hi>like a toad,</hi> will ſuck poyſon out of every thing. Or <hi>like the ſalt ſea,</hi> will turn all ſorts of water into its own briniſh taſt. As a believer improveth all kinds of diſpenſations, to ſet him with greateſt deteſtation againſt ſin: ſo doth a carnal heart make uſe of them, as <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> unto ſin.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt other incouragements unto evil, the example of a <hi>multitude</hi> is wont to be of much prevailing efficacy. The practiſe of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhould <hi>increaſe deteſtation;</hi> but ſinners are

Hence it is the deſign of the devil, to ſear mens conſciences, and to lull them aſleep in ſecurity, that they may not be diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted or interrupted in his ſervice. And they are willing <hi>for the moſt part,</hi> to comply with Satan herein; Fain they would drink down the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, without any remorſe upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to embitter that cup. They deſire to be ſoothed up in their wickedneſs, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any thing that hath a tendency to diſcover the evil they are about; or to awaken them out of their carnal peace. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.10. <hi>They ſay to the Seers, ſee net: and to the Prophets, Propheſie not unto us right things: Speak unto us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits,</hi> Jer. 5.31. <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo.</hi> This is that which pleaſeth them well, if miniſters would deal tenderly with them, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106335:20"/>never meddle with their ſins: If they would bear them in hand, that they might be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving their wonted practiſe. For then a ſinner might ſay as the drunkard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.35. <hi>They have ſtriken me, and I was not ſick: they have beaten me and I felt it not.</hi> I took my liberty to ſerve my luſts, and never felt the ſmart of it. For when conſcience is ſeared, then Satan leads the ſinner captive at his pleaſure: He can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his inordinate deſires, and yet have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions to affright him.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>A ſpecial means that is made uſe of, by the ſons and daughters of men, to ſtifle the workings of conſcience, that it may not rebuke and condemn them for ſin, is by ſtanding up in juſtification and defence of their ſin: that ſo it may ſeem to be a matter that may be juſtly practiſed, and no way diſpleaſing in the ſight of God.</hi> When the <hi>affections</hi> are violently bent on that which is evil, they do prompt the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> to find out arguments to plead for it. <hi>Corrupt paſſions blind the judgment,</hi> and ſometimes
<note n="*" place="margin">Perit rectum judicium, cum res tranſic in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus.</note> 
                  <hi>bribe the judgment,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent wayes and reaſons to guild over a wickedneſs; that it may not appear in its proper colours: But may look like that which is good and honeſt. Therefore you read of perſons <hi>waſhing over</hi> their iniquities, and pleading <hi>innocency</hi> in their tranſgreſſions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Though thou waſh thee with nitre; and take thee much ſope, yet thine iniquity is marked before me ſaith the Lord God,</hi> i. e. Though thou putteſt a <hi>fair gloſs</hi> upon a <hi>foul matter,</hi> and haſt many <hi>excuſes</hi> and <hi>evaſions</hi> whereby to avoid the charg of guilt upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106335:20"/>thy ſoul; yet it is naked and evident before mine eyes, <hi>ſaith the Lord.</hi> Again v. 23. <hi>How canſt thou ſay, I am not polluted?</hi> And v. 24. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will ye plead with me? intimating</hi> that they were ready to juſtifie their wickedneſs, and had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to plead for the warrant of it. See what pains <hi>Saul</hi> takes to cover his ſin, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his rebellion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.20. <hi>I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord ſent me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. To compleat this matter and bring it home to our purpoſe, <hi>take this third propoſition. That the example of the multitude is a principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſinners produce to this end,</hi> and much inſiſt upon to this purpoſe; <hi>namely to juſtifie and defend their ungodly deeds, and to maintain the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions wherewith they are defiled.</hi> If ſuch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were ſinful, do ye think ſo many perſons would comply with it? Have not they cauſe to be careful of their ſouls, <hi>as well as we?</hi> And have not they as good knowledg of the mind of God, <hi>as we have?</hi> If it were ſo bad <hi>to tipple</hi> and lye in the alehouſe, <hi>now and then,</hi> do you think, ſo many <hi>judicious</hi> men would practiſe it? If it were a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to <hi>game,</hi> and <hi>revel,</hi> and <hi>the like,</hi> would not others leave it? If ſuch a worſhip were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, can you imagine, that ſo many <hi>knowing men</hi> would not abhorre it? ſhall we think our ſelves to be wiſer then the moſt? Theſe are the <hi>reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of mens ſpirits, whereby they ſtrive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their crooked wayes. As <hi>Eliphas</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Job cap.</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. <hi>Art thou the firſt man that was born? Or waſt thou made before the hills? Haſt thou heard the ſecret of God? and doſt thou reſtrain wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106335:21"/>to thy ſelf? What knoweſt thou that we know not? what underſtandeſt thou which is not in us?</hi> So are ſinners apt to argue the caſe, when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for any indirect practiſe. <hi>Do you think your ſelf wiſer than the moſt?</hi> They make no ſcruple at ſuch things, <hi>and have they not as much knowledg as we? Shall we be ſo arrogant as to reſtrain wiſdom to our ſelves?</hi> Surely it is not to be condemned, or otherwiſe ſo many would not approve of it, and follow it. For <hi>mind it Sirs as a moſt certain rule;</hi> that as the cuſtom and the commoneſs of the practiſe of ſin, doth uſually take away the ſenſe and conſcience of ſin, in them that commit it; ſo it many times takes away the opinion of ſin, in them that obſerve it. Surely, <hi>think they,</hi> if there were any harm in it, people would not ſo readily and univerſally cloſe with it. It was the very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they brought againſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the religion of his followers, becauſe it was generally oppoſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.22. <hi>As concerning this ſect, we know it is every where ſpoken againſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the deadning of this influence I ſhall intreat you to obſerve and lay to heart <hi>theſe three things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That this is double wickedneſs in the ſight of God, and ſo may juſtly expoſe us to a greater meaſure of his indignation, for a perſon not only to live in the practiſe of ſin, but to defend and juſtifie thoſe practiſes.</hi> For a man firſt to break the law of God, and then to plead againſt the law, and as much as in him lieth to enervate and invalidate the obligatory power of it. This is one of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that can be offered againſt the Lord of glory. And it is far from the temper of a true
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106335:21"/>believer. A child of God may fall, through temptation, into ſin; <hi>but he will not plead the cauſe of ſin;</hi> He will ſtand up in defence of the word of God againſt himſelf, and take confuſion of face unto himſelf. But when a wicked man doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to maintain his wickedneſs, <hi>that</hi> is an high affront unto the Sovereign Lord, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: It is in effect <hi>to ſet his mouth againſt the heavens,</hi> as it is expreſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.8, 9. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, an heathen <hi>Philoſopher</hi> being asked his opinion, what they deſerved who committed murder, or adultery, in their drunkeneſs, and then excuſed it becauſe they were in drink: <hi>His anſwer was</hi> that ſuch ſhould be twice puniſhed; firſt <hi>for the fact committed,</hi> and again <hi>for their drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs.</hi> So may I ſay of ſinners of this ſort, God may juſtly execute upon them the fierceneſs of his anger, and make them taſt the ſoreſt of his diſpleaſure; <hi>He may deſtroy them with a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; firſt for the evils which they commit,</hi> and again <hi>for the juſtifying of thoſe evils.</hi> You have a particular woe denounced on this account <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Wo unto them that ſay concerning evil, it is good; and of good, it is evil: that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs: that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For a perſon thus to plead in defence of his ſin, it is to put himſelf at the greateſt diſtance from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion, and conſequentially from the pardoning grace and favour of God annexed thereunto.</hi> The reaſon is apparent, becauſe <hi>conviction</hi> is the firſt ſtep that leads to <hi>converſion.</hi> It is impoſſible a ſinner ſhould be humbled for, or turned from his ungodlineſs, till he be convinced of it. As
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106335:22"/>long as he ſtands up in juſtification of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, he will never loath and abhor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for them. And therefore when the Lord cometh in a way of ſaving mercy to a ſoul, and takes him into a covenant with himſelf, he doth take them off, from pleading in their own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification any further, that they may lye down in their ſhame, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord. That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Mark it, before time, their mouthes were opened and they had ſomething to ſpeak in their own behalf, <hi>all the world almoſt went on in ſuch a way, and why might not we as well as others? and the like.</hi> But when the ſpirit works effectually, and bringeth them into the bond of the covenant, you ſhall not hear a word more of theſe corrupt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Now</hi> they ſee their vileneſs, and that they have nothing farther to plead; but <hi>they lay their hands upon their mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The rectitude, or irregularity, of any courſe or action, is not to be meaſured and judged from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the greateſt number of men, but by the word of the living God.</hi> It is the ſcripture which is the <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> both for the trying of doctrines, whether they are ſound or corrupt; and for the weighing of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or warrantable.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Non eo animentur quia multi ſunt, ſed hoc ipſo mag is reprimantur, quia non pauci ſunt. Nihil ad extenuationem delicti numerus impudens vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conſuevit.</hi> Cypr. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 26.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106335:22"/>the practiſes of the generality are ſo far from juſtifying any proceedings whatſoever, that we have cauſe to ſuſpect them, <hi>on that very account:</hi> Becauſe it is ſuch an ordinary thing for them to combine together in the ſervice of the devil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>For the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>have dealt very treacherouſly againſt me ſaith the Lord. They have belied the Lord, and ſaid, it is not he, neither ſhall evil come upon us, neither ſhall we ſee ſword nor famine,</hi> Jer. 6.13. <hi>From the leaſt of them, even unto the greateſt of them, every one is given to covetouſneſs: and from the prophet even unto the prieſt, every one dealeth falſly.</hi> Mark it, it was not here and there a ſingle perſon, but the whole body of the people <hi>collectively</hi> and <hi>unanimouſly</hi> were corrupted, men of all ranks and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that for the trying of the particulars of your converſation you muſt not paſs ſentence according to the general practiſe; but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Law and the teſtimony, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 59. <hi>I thought on my waies, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi> So much for the <hi>firſt influence</hi> which the example of the multitude hath to lead into ſin, <hi>viz. By miniſtring an argument for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The example of a multitude is commonly a powerful inducement to the commiſſion of ſin, <hi>By contributing to the extenuation and leſſening of the evil of ſin.</hi> From hence perſons will conclude that, if an action be granted <hi>to be evil,</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>it is not ſo great an evil,</hi> as ſome would perſwade them: ſurely it is but a ſmall matter, and of no heinous nature, or elſe others would
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106335:23"/>avoid it, and it would not be ſo commonly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. <hi>Thus Sirs;</hi> if a man hath but ſlight and low apprehenſions of the evil of ſin, he will never be ſtedfaſt and reſolute in oppoſition againſt it: he will ſoon be brought to a complyance with it. <hi>As your thoughts of ſin are, ſo your carriage towards it</hi> in a meaſure <hi>will be.</hi> If it be reckoned as a little evil, men will never be at any great coſt, or make much adoe for the avoiding of it. <hi>Now,</hi> the conſideration of the practiſe of a <hi>multitude,</hi> that many walk in ſuch a way, doth hugely tend to the <hi>extenuation</hi> of the evil of it, in a mans thoughts. <hi>It is a difficult thing, to keep up abhorring thoughts, in the Soul, of that which multitudes live in the practiſe of.</hi> They will be ready to conclude that, <hi>without controverſy,</hi> there is no great hurt in it, nor any conſiderable danger: or otherwiſe ſo many would not agree together therein. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Then he ſaid unto me, haſt thou ſeen this, O ſon of man? It it a light thing to the houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>that they commit the abominations which they commit here? Obſerve,</hi> it was a general corruption, and ſo accounted ſmall in their eyes. <hi>Is it a light thing? q. d.</hi> It is in your eſtimation, but a ſmall matter. Certainly you reckon it but a light and trivial thing, little to be regarded. And <hi>thus</hi> the people anſwered the prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> when he laboured to ſet before them the greatneſs of their folly, and wickedneſs; they produce <hi>the general practiſe</hi> for it. It is that <hi>which we have done, we, and our fathers, our Kings, and our Princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 44. v. 7.17.</p>
               <p>To abate the force of this influence, let us
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106335:23"/>duly ponder and preſs upon our ſpirits, <hi>theſe three particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Although all ſins, if conſidered comparatively, are not equally heynous,</hi> ſome being of leſſer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, and others of a crimſon die; <hi>yet there is no ſin little in it ſelf, or that has but little evil in the nature of it.</hi> It is an argument of a <hi>graceleſs heart,</hi> that is an utter ſtranger to the ſpirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>to account any ſin to be a ſmall evil.</hi> For hadſt thou layn under the burden of thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and felt that ſmart, and bitterneſs in the ſenſe of ſin, which is the uſual preparative, and antecedent to a ſaving converſion, it would rectifie thy thoughts in this reſpect: thou wouldſt account the guilt of the <hi>leaſt ſin,</hi> to be an <hi>inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table burden.</hi> And indeed there is reaſon for it: For the leaſt tranſgreſſion cannot be expiated at a lower rate, then <hi>by the precious bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as of a lamb without ſpot, or blemiſh.</hi> All the angels <hi>in heaven,</hi> and all the treaſures <hi>upon earth,</hi> cannot make an attonement, for the leaſt offence, againſt the Law of God. The ſmalleſt ſin is a contempt of the great King, even of the Lord of hoſts, who is of infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable majeſty, and excellency. You know, the horridneſs of a fact is not only to be collected from <hi>the matter wherein it doth conſiſt,</hi> but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally from <hi>the object againſt whom it is committed.</hi> That which is but a <hi>petty miſdemeanor</hi> if againſt another, is <hi>treaſon</hi> if done againſt a King. <hi>Why, Sirs,</hi> every ſin is a ſlighting of the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords; it is a riſing up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the ſovereign poſſeſſour of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> argueth againſt the temptation,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106335:24"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> So ſhould you reaſon the caſe againſt conjunction with a <hi>multitude,</hi> in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt way: Though all the world be defiled, with this, or the other abomination, yet I perceive it is rebellion againſt the
<note n="*" place="margin">Omne peccatum eſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icidium.</note> incomprehenſible God, and <hi>how ſhall I dare to joyn in confederacy with them?</hi> Iſa 7.13. <hi>Heare ye now, O houſe of David, Is it a ſmall thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God alſo? q. d.</hi> Can that be a light thing, which is a deſpiſing of the Lord, and an ecclipſing of his glory? Is it a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that openeth the door of hell, and makes the ſinner liable to everlaſting condemnation? Why, <hi>the wages of ſin</hi> [<hi>quatenus</hi> ſin, and therefore of the ſmalleſt tranſgreſſion] <hi>is death</hi> [everlaſting death and deſtruction, as appeareth by its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to eternal life] <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This is ſo farre from leſſening the evil of ſin, becauſe it is generally practiſed; that it is one aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating circumſtance of it, whereby the danger is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed:</hi> And therefore it ſhould render us more watchful againſt it, and cauſe us to be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and circumſpect, leaſt we be defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, As with an <hi>infectious diſeaſe,</hi> the more <hi>epidemical</hi> it is, the more <hi>perillous;</hi> and the greater care will perſons take againſt the <hi>contagion.</hi> I dare ſay, that in a town where is the <hi>plague,</hi> or <hi>peſtilence,</hi> the farther it ſpreads, the more fearful would the inhabitants be. <hi>O that men would ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the health of their ſouls, according to the care they take of their bodies!</hi> And that they were affected with <hi>ſpiritual</hi> evils and maladies, as they are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106335:24"/>wont to be with <hi>temporal!</hi> Then they would keep a ſtrict watch againſt common abominations. The Prophet ſpeaks of it as an heightner of the guilt, that it was like a <hi>ſpreading leproſie</hi> that went through the whole body of the Land, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.26, 28. <hi>O daughter of my people, gird thee with ſackcloth, and wallow thy ſelf in aſhes: make thee mourning as for an only ſon, moſt bitter lamentation: for the ſpoiler ſhall come ſuddenly upon us.</hi> What is the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby this ſore evil is procured? <hi>Why</hi> ſee v. 28. <hi>They are all grievous revolters, walking with ſlanders: they are braſs and iron, they are all corrupters.</hi> And again, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ye are curſed with a curſe</hi> [i. e. you are <hi>certainly,</hi> and <hi>dreadfully,</hi> and <hi>terribly,</hi> accurſed] <hi>for you have robbed me, even this whole Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Is it a ſmall matter (as thou pleadeſt) that is thus done againſt the Lord?</hi> Why, <hi>then the greater is thy contempt of his Majeſty, and the more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble art thou, in deſpiſing the Holy one of Iſrael.</hi> Wilt thou prefer a <hi>trivial matter</hi> before the pleaſing of God, and the enjoyment of his favour? This is a ſhrewd ſign that thou wouldeſt not ſerve him in a greater. How couldeſt thou lay down <hi>thy life</hi> for his ſake, and part with <hi>all that thou haſt</hi> at his call, who wilt diſobey him for a triſle, <hi>as it is in thine account?</hi> If you go to a <hi>neighbour,</hi> or <hi>friend,</hi> to lend you a ſmall ſum of money, or to do you a leſſer kindneſs, and he will not do it; you will preſently conclude, He would never be at any great expence to do you good, nor truſt you with a matter of any conſiderable value. <hi>So may the Lord ſay in this caſe,</hi> This is an <hi>hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wretch</hi> who thus complieth with the <hi>multitude,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106335:25"/>to ſin againſt me, <hi>in a ſmall matter;</hi> Surely he will never ſtick cloſe to me, <hi>in times of danger,</hi> and <hi>difficulty;</hi> when he muſt exerciſe any <hi>greater meaſure of ſelf-denial.</hi> You know the words of our Saviour unto <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26.40. <hi>He come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Peter</hi> had promiſed, that although he ſhould die with Chriſt, yet he would not deny him: and and therefore he ſaid unto <hi>Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? q. d.</hi> How couldeſt thou die for me? <hi>If thou faulter in the ſmalleſt, how wouldeſt thou be able to grapple with greater hardſhips?</hi> So ſhould you reaſon the caſe with your own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: If I will be a Chriſtian indeed, I muſt be ready to forſake all that I have at his command, and to follow him through tribulations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes whitherſoever he leadeth me: And <hi>how ſhall I be able to do it, if I ſtick with him for a trifle?</hi> Beſides, <hi>as was intimated before,</hi> It is a monſtrous and intolerable ſlighting, and undervaluing the <hi>autherity of God,</hi> and that <hi>eternal bleſſedneſs</hi> to be enjoyed in his preſence, to venture the loſs of it, for matter of little weight and moment. This is inſtead of <hi>counting all things to be but droſs and dung, in compariſon of the favour of God,</hi> to eſteem <hi>droſs and dung</hi> above the light of his countenance. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Hath a Nation changed their gods, which yet are no gods? But my people have changed their glory, for that which doth not profit. Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106335:41"/>be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord. For my people have committed two evils: they have forſaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that can hold no water; q. d,</hi> If they had exchanged me for ſomething of <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>value,</hi> the contempt had not been ſo great: but they caſt me off, for that which is of no worth. <hi>The weaner and the ſlighter is the object, wherewith you cloſe in contradiction unto Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the greater is your contempt of his Majeſty, and the lighter eſteem you have of his loving-kindneſs.</hi> So much for <hi>the ſecond influence,</hi> which the practiſe of the <hi>multitude</hi> hath to draw perſons to ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> By contributing to the <hi>extenuation,</hi> and <hi>leſſening</hi> the evil of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the practiſe of the multitude men are uſually drawn into ſin, <hi>By being from thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, to expect impunity in their ſins; and to be free from the judgments that are deſerved thereby.</hi> Surely, <hi>think they,</hi> the Lord will ſpare us, for we are a great number; he will not execute his wrath upon ſo many. <hi>Take it thus, Sirs:</hi> That paſſion which God doth make eſpecial uſe of, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt ſin, it is <hi>the paſſion of fear, and dread of his judgments;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> both as to the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>wicked,</hi> the <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>unjuſt.</hi> This made <hi>Laban</hi> the Idolater, that he durſt not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor ſpeak a word to his hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the dread of the wrath of God was upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.24, 29. And this reſtrained the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that they durſt not diſturb <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in his reformation, <hi>The fear of God was upon all the Kingdoms of thoſe Countries, when they had heard
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106335:42"/>that the Lord fought againſt the enemies of Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.29. And what made <hi>Job</hi> ſo ſtrict and preciſe in his carriage, that he made a Covenant with his eyes, that he might not ſo much as think upon a maid? that he did not deſpiſe the cauſe of his man-ſervant or his maid-ſervant when they contended with him? See what account he giveth of it, himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1, 2, 3. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the wicked, and a ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity?</hi> And again v. 23. <hi>For deſtruction from God was a terrour to me, and by reaſon of his highneſs I could not endure. So that,</hi> when ſinners have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but ſome competent meaſure of preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hopes, that they ſhall be free from divine vengeance, notwithſtanding their tranſgreſſions; this will let looſe the reins of reſtraint, and open the current to all profaneſs and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn God? He hath ſaid in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</hi> And ſo much is plainly intimated, in the Apoſtles <hi>queſtion</hi> to the impenitent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that judgeſt them which do ſuch things, and doest the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God? q. d.</hi> Certainly theſe are thy vain imaginations, and the ſecret workings of thy ſpirit. For did the ungodly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and conſider, that they ſhall be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned for ſin, It would cauſe their hearts to tremble, in the very apprehenſions of lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of it. If they were in expectation of the judgments of God, as the certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of their impieties, they would haſten to make their peace with him; and nothing ſhould hinder them from returning to him by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106335:42"/>But, <hi>the truth is,</hi> they hope to eſcape, and <hi>to have peace, though they walk in the imaginations of their evil hearts.</hi> Now, the example of a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> doth confirm theſe hopes, and ſtrengthen them mightily in ſuch expectations. For they are apt to conceive, that however the Lord may proceed in ſeverity againſt ſome <hi>particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> yet he will not deſtroy a <hi>multitude</hi> when they are joyned together. See how ſinners argue themſelves into a <hi>Fools-confidence</hi> from this very conſideration, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.24. <hi>Son of man, they that inhabit thoſe waſts of the land of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſpeak, ſaying,</hi> Abraham <hi>was one, and he inherited the land: But we are many, the land is given us for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Mark it, They make no queſtion, but God would deal favourably with them, becauſe <hi>they were many.</hi> The Lord had threatened them by his Prophets, with utter deſolation and ruine, becauſe of their abominations; and that the land wherein they dwelt ſhould ſpue them out. Yea, but, <hi>ſay they,</hi> we cannot believe it; <hi>God gave this land to</hi> Abraham, <hi>who was but one, and behold we are many; and therefore undoubtedly he will have mercy upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To diſcover a little the weakneſs and folly of this <hi>argumentation,</hi> let me beſeech you to give heedful attendance to theſe <hi>three particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Although the conſideration of a</hi> multitude <hi>may carry ſome ſtroke with men, as to the mitigating, or with-holding the puniſhment deſerved: yet it is of no validity whatſoever, to ſtave off the execution of the vengeance of God, or to abate the ſeverity of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</hi> For he is of infinite power, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly bleſſed in the enjoyment of himſelf.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106335:43"/>
                  <hi>Indeed,</hi> men are wont to forbear the executing the rigour of the Law, when a multitude offend together; or at moſt they puniſh <hi>but ſome,</hi> for an example and terrour to the reſt. <hi>And what is the reaſon of it?</hi> Why, poſſibly it may be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to provoke many thouſands, by the rigour of the law; and may force them to run upon <hi>deſperate courſes:</hi> Perhaps, they to whom the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice</hi> is committed, have not <hi>power</hi> to bring under the whole body of a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without uſing <hi>lenitives,</hi> and <hi>mildneſs</hi> towards ſome; and ingaging for their <hi>ſecurity</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity.</hi> Or <hi>in ſome caſes,</hi> the common-wealth would be <hi>impaired,</hi> and a Nation or Kingdom <hi>diſpenpled,</hi> if all that have their hand in a rebellion ſhould be cut off together. But <hi>alas,</hi> what are theſe things in reference to the God of heaven? <hi>Is there any thing too hard for the Lord? Is it not as eaſie for him, to cut off many as few? Doth he ſtand in need of your ſervice, that he ſhould ſpare you, out of reſpect to his own advantage? Why man,</hi> All thy ſervice and homage doth not extend unto the Lord. He hath <hi>thouſand thouſands</hi> miniſtring unto him, and <hi>ten thouſand times ten thouſand</hi> attending upon him. He can bring glory to himſelf in thine utter extirpation and deſtruction. And ſee what he hath ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.</hi> So that, if a whole Kingdom or Countrey; <hi>nay,</hi> if many people and Countreys conſpire together in ſin, the Lord will not ſpare them; but will bind them in bundles together, and caſt them into the furnace of fire. So in that dreadful <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>boiling pot,</hi> Ezek. 24.6. <hi>Wo to the bloody City, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106335:43"/>the pot whoſe ſcum is therein, and whoſe ſcum is not not gone out of it; bring it out piece by piece, let no lot fall upon it.</hi> It is as much <hi>as if God had ſaid,</hi> They are <hi>univerſally</hi> corrupted, and I will deſtroy them all, I will not have compaſſion on any one of them. It is ſpoken in <hi>alluſion</hi> to the practiſe of <hi>Commanders in war;</hi> when Souldiers mutiny, they do not wont to cut off a whole legion, or regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but only ſome are made <hi>exemplary,</hi> and to that end they uſed <hi>to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt lots,</hi> who ſhould die, and which of them ſhould be ſpared: and the like <hi>lottery</hi> was uſed, when <hi>captives</hi> were taken, for the ſaving of ſome, and putting others to the ſword. Well, but, <hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> I will deal with theſe <hi>rebels</hi> after another rate; I will utterly conſume them without exemption of any: <hi>There ſhall no lot fall upon them.</hi> And ſtudy well <hi>that Scripture</hi> which is peculiarly deſigned to overthrow this ground of preſumption, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Though hand joyn in hand, the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed; i. e.</hi> Though ſinners ſtrengthen themſelves by mutual <hi>counſels</hi> and <hi>combinations;</hi> and joyn together in parties, for the doing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yet it ſhall not ſtand them in ſtead: The God of heaven will break in upon them, in his fury, and ſweep them away with the beſom of deſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: He will pull them out piece-meal, one after another, and there ſhall none of them eſcape. And if you do not ſee this alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted <hi>viſibly,</hi> in ſignal outward judgments; yet you muſt remember there are <hi>ſpiritual plagues</hi> poured out upon the wicked here, which are the foreſt of judgments; and <hi>that the wicked are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unto the day of deſtruction, and ſhall be brought forth to the day of wraths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106335:44"/>2. <hi>The examples of the judgments of God, that are upon record in the word, may abundantly ſuffice to ſhew the vanity of this kind of reaſoning.</hi> When the greateſt numbers have conſpired, to reject his word, and to trample upon his glory, <hi>what hath been the manner of his dealing with them? Why,</hi> He hath come down in the heighth of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt them, and ſet them forth as <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deigmes,</hi> or publike examples of his juſtice; that others might be induced to take warning. Look into the wilderneſs, <hi>when the people did joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to</hi> Baal Peor, <hi>and did eat the ſacrifices of the dead,</hi> Pſal. 106.28. <hi>i. e.</hi> when they did partake of the worſhip that was tendered to <hi>Idols,</hi> which are but <hi>dead Gods,</hi> which never had any reality of being, and forſook <hi>Jehovah</hi> who is the living and true God: when they were ſharers with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their offerings: or <hi>by the ſacrifices of the dead,</hi> you may underſtand, the <hi>funeral banquets</hi> which amongſt Idolatrous Nations were uſed by way of ſolemn <hi>parentation</hi> to the dead. You will find that this idolatry was a ſpreading corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>multitudes</hi> were defiled with it: And <hi>were they delivered becauſe of their multitude?</hi> Why, conſult the Hiſtory, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. <hi>The plague brake in amongſt them, and there dyed in one day three and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand;</hi> and afterwards a thouſand more. And this inſtance of ſeverity is recorded <hi>for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8, 11. Let us look a little higher into the caſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha, Admah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of which Cities were a great company, and they were in confederacy together in ſin, <hi>both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106335:44"/>And were they ſpared becauſe they were many? See <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24, 25. <hi>Then the Lord rained upon</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>brimſtone and fire from the Lord, out of heaven. And he overthrew thoſe Cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that which grew upon the ground.</hi> In the old world there was a numerous multitude, and <hi>all fleſh had corrupted their way, and filled the earth with violence.</hi> And were they exempted from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon the account of their <hi>numbers?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Lord ſpared them for a time, and his long-ſuffering waited expecting their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but at length <hi>he brought the flood upon the world of the ungodly.</hi> The fallen angels were a very comprehenſive body, of glorious creatures, and yet <hi>when they kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitationp God hath reſerved them in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> But, you will ſay, what are theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto us? We hope the Lord will not be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere now in the days of the Goſpel. Mark there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth argue from this <hi>Topick,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 9. <hi>If God ſpared not the angels that ſinned, but caſt them down into hell,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſpared not the old world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and turning the cities of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an enſample to thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly: The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgment to be puniſhed: q. d.</hi> He is the <hi>ſame</hi> God, as <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> as ever, and hateth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with as perfect an hatred, and will repay them that hate him to their face.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The conjunction of many together, in any evil
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106335:45"/>way, is ſo far from procuring freedom from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is a ſhrewd argument of unavoidable wrath and deſtruction, hanging over the heads of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> This very thing will <hi>accelerate</hi> and <hi>haſten</hi> the ruine and deſolation; and cauſe it to come with the greater <hi>ſpeed, undoubtedneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeverity,</hi> when ſin begins to grow ripe, by ſpreading it ſelf amongſt a <hi>multitude.</hi> So that it is a groſs and palpable deluſion, to imagine, that God will forbear to puniſh, becauſe a <hi>multitude</hi> ſin; for however he may deal with <hi>ſingle perſons,</hi> yet he will never ſuffer an <hi>united company</hi> to eſcape, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.10, 13. <hi>Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to them that ſhall inherit them, for every one, from the leaſt even to the greateſt, is given to covetouſneſs: from the Prophet, even unto the Prieſt, every one dealeth falſely,</hi> Iſa. 2.8, 9. <hi>Their land alſo is full of idols, they worſhip the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: And the mean man boweth down, and the great man hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf, therefore forgive them not.</hi> That is <hi>the third way,</hi> how the practiſe of a <hi>multitude</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to ſin, by cauſing them to hope for impunity in their ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sinners are induced to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a multitude in the commiſſion of evil, <hi>Becauſe that is a ready fence againſt the ſhame, that would otherwiſe ariſe from the evil committed.</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think it <hi>no ſhame,</hi> to do what is commonly done, though it be never ſo vile: They never bluſh to walk in a ſinful courſe, wherein they have the <hi>generality</hi> to lead them the way. Let me open it <hi>thus</hi> unto you, <hi>my brethren.</hi> The reaſon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106335:45"/>why many abſtain from the actual perpetration of ſome wickedneſſes, to which they are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, it is <hi>not for conſcience towards God,</hi> or out of any reſpect they have to his commandments; But <hi>ſhame of the world doth reſtrain them,</hi> and keep them within compaſs. The world would cry out of them, if they did ſuch an evil: it would tend to their <hi>reproach,</hi> and <hi>diſgrace,</hi> and <hi>ignominy,</hi> in the face of all that dwell round about them: they ſhould not be able to look their neighbours in the face. And therefore it is, that <hi>in ſecret</hi> they can take liberty to give thoſe corruptions vent, which are kept under, and ſmothered <hi>in open view:</hi> They will not ſtick to do thoſe things <hi>in the cloſet,</hi> and in the <hi>private chambers,</hi> which they are very loath ſhould come upon the <hi>publique ſtage of the world.</hi> You read of ſuch perſons, who in the eyes of men carried matters <hi>ſmooth</hi> and <hi>fair,</hi> and poſſibly with a ſeeming auſterity and gravity; <hi>when it was a ſhame to ſpeak of thoſe things, which were done of them in ſecret, Eph.</hi> 5.12. So that if the ſhame of the world were removed, if that obſtacle were but taken out of the way, then they could run on freely to all exceſs of riot: and make no <hi>bones</hi> in ſwallowing ſuch impieties as now they boggle at. We find it of the men of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> that they dwelt careleſs and ſecure, <hi>for there was no Magiſtrate to put them to ſhame in any thing, Judg.</hi> 18.7. Now the <hi>commonneſs</hi> of a ſin doth uſually take from the <hi>ſhamefulneſs</hi> of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is alwayes a ſhameful thing in it ſelf; but the ſeeing of multitudes commit it, doth notably help to <hi>harden</hi> mens <hi>faces,</hi> and <hi>to ſteel</hi> their <hi>fore-heads,</hi> that they are not ſenſible of it. Men are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106335:46"/>aſhamed to go on <hi>ſingly,</hi> and <hi>perſonally,</hi> in any way of ungodlineſs; when they are no whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be led by the company of others, and to do as the reſt of their ſociety doth. You read in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.13. of a general deluge of corruption and naughtineſs that had overflowed the whole land: and mark what followeth, v. 15. <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To enervate the ſtrength of this <hi>fourth influence</hi> it hath, let us often reſolve in our moſt ſerious and deliberate contemplations theſe <hi>three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is a ſure token of abundant, deſperate atheiſm, lodging in the heart, and that mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth over the heart, when a ſinner is kept from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, meerly from the ſhame of the world, and is not afraid of them in the preſence of God.</hi> Why <hi>man,</hi> doſt thou believe that there is a God in heaven, that beholdeth all the dwellers upon earth? whoſe eyes are upon all the wayes of man, and who pondereth all his goings? And art thou not aſhamed to commit abominations in his ſight? Should not the regard of the moſt high have a greater efficacy upon thy ſpirit, to keep thee from ſin, than all the cryes of the children of men? The truth of it is, thou art an <hi>atheiſt,</hi> and doſt not believe there is a God, or elſe thou caſteſt the thoughts of him behind thy back, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. And if thou forgetteſt the Lord, or denyeſt his being, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould in mercy be mindful of thee: Well mayeſt thou fear leſt he ſhould come upon thee in ſome <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>terrible
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106335:46"/>judgments,</hi> in order to the confutation of thy <hi>atheiſtical</hi> heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22. <hi>Conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Although an impenitent ſinner may eſcape the ſhame of the world here, yet he ſhall not be able to eſcape everlaſting ſhame and contempt hereafter, when he is brought before the tribunal ſeat of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> How will he then be aſhamed of his <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>madneſs,</hi> in regarding the cries of men, more than the word of God? How will he be then filled with confuſion, to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was ſo ſottiſh and vile as to ſerve the devil, the Prince of darkneſs, rather than to be obedient to the voice of the Lord of glory? With what vexation and torment will it then fill a mans ſpirit, to remember, that he was offered ſalvation amongſt the little flock of Jeſus Chriſt, but he choſe rather to go to hell with the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</hi> A reflexion upon this will cover the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners face with blackneſs, and make him ready to tear out his very bowels with indignation. <hi>O, will he think,</hi> what phrenſy did poſſeſs me, that I ſhould act after this manner? What a wretch was I, thus to neglect my ſoul? What a blind ignorant unadviſed courſe did I take, to go with the <hi>multitude</hi> in the broad way of deſtruction? <hi>Then ſhall the wicked be covered with ſhame,</hi> and <hi>their everlaſting confuſion ſhall never be forgotten,</hi> as the expreſſion is <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.11. When the Saints of God ſhall lift up their heads with boldneſs and confidence, then ſhall all the ungodly hang down their heads as a <hi>bulruſh,</hi> and be aſhamed to look Jeſus Chriſt in the face, whoſe laws they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106335:47"/>deſpiſed, and preferred the pleaſing and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude before him. For you know that is one of the <hi>differences</hi> which God will put between his own ſervants, and evil doers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All ſin whatſoever is ſhameful in its own nature and tendency, as conſidered in it ſelf, and however it is committed; though no eye of the world take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of it.</hi> Is it not a ſhameful thing for a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature</hi> to be in ſubjection to <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual luſts</hi> and pleaſures? For a <hi>man</hi> to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a condition, viler than the <hi>beaſts</hi> that periſh? For a perſon to be ſo beſotted, as to ſell his ſoul for a trifle? Is it not a <hi>ſhameful thing</hi> for a knowing creature to rebel againſt his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, upon whom he hath his conſtant depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and by whom he wholly ſubſiſt? Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> if ever God intend you mercy, he will cauſe you to bear your ſhame, and to loath your ſelves upon the account of your iniquities: He will open your eyes, and cauſe you to ſee that the ſhamefulneſs of ſin doth not only lye in the opinions of men, but in its own nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. <hi>And there you ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your wayes, and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled, and ye ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for all the evils that ye have committed.</hi> And ſee the language of true converts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.25. <hi>We lie down in our ſhame and our confuſion covereth us: for we have ſinned againſt the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.</hi> Thus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106335:47"/>I have diſpatched the <hi>fourth incouragement to ſin</hi> taken from the practiſe of the multitude.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Perſons are eaſily prevailed with, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a multitude in their ſins; <hi>Leſt they ſhould be reproached and reviled, for diſſenting from them: leſt they ſhould beſpatter them, and caſt dirt upon them, if they withdraw from their fellowſhip.</hi> My brethren, if a man will not joyn with the multitude <hi>in the work of their hands,</hi> he ſhall be ſure to ſuffer under <hi>the laſh of their tongue.</hi> If he will not <hi>do evil</hi> with them, they will be ſure <hi>to ſpeak evil</hi> of him. They will brand him for a <hi>factious, troubleſom,</hi> and <hi>ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> perſon; one that is over much wedded to his own way; and proud, and high conceited of himſelf. They will be apt to mark him as the <hi>troubler of Iſrael,</hi> and the peſt and plague of the land wherein he dwelleth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Wherein they think it ſtrange, that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot? ſpeaking evil of you.</hi> Mind it, if you ſeparate from them in your <hi>converſation,</hi> they will do what in them lyeth, to blaſt your <hi>reputation.</hi> And to avoid this reproach, people are eaſily perſwaded to cloſe with them. For it is an hard thing to ſuffer taunts, and revilings, for the ſake of Chriſt: becauſe of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous pride that is in mens hearts. They have high thoughts of themſelves, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that others ſhould vilifie and debaſe them. There are many who can rather ſuffer <hi>loſs</hi> in their <hi>eſtates,</hi> and ſome <hi>pains</hi> to be inflicted on their <hi>bodies,</hi> than <hi>reproach</hi> ſhould be caſt upon their <hi>names.</hi> Hence they are called <hi>cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> becauſe they pierce deep into the ſoul, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106335:48"/>lye heavy upon the ſpirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. And the heart of <hi>David</hi> was even broken with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heavineſs.</hi> This had almoſt turned aſide the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> from the courſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, had he not been kept by an almighty power, and followed with the effectual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>I am in deriſion daily, every one mocketh me. For ſince I ſpake, I cryed violence and ſpoil, becauſe the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and a deriſion daily. Then I ſaid I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To fence you againſt the prevalency of this powerful temptation, there are <hi>five things</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſeriouſly weighed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are you likely to be reproached for the ſake of Chriſt, and becauſe you will not ſay, <hi>a confederacy</hi> with the multitude in ſin? Why, <hi>this is none other than he hath particularly warned you of, that you ſhould expect, and look for, if you will be faithful unto him, and ſtedfaſt in his covenant.</hi> This is one of the <hi>termes</hi> and <hi>articles,</hi> upon which ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt is propounded and offered unto ſinners, <hi>that you be willing to be made a reproach for his ſake, and to be accounted as the ſcum of the world, and the offscouring of all things.</hi> If you are <hi>Iſraelites indeed,</hi> diſciples of Chriſt in reality, this will undoubtedly come upon you: You will be reckoned as the worſt and vileſt of men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſome ſeaſons, when religion is diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced. So that this is part of the coſt you muſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106335:48"/>reckon to be at, if you will be wiſe builders in the matters of eternity. This is one of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances</hi> that is entayled upon godlineſs, and the favour of the moſt High: and if you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his favour, you muſt have it with all the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances</hi> that attend it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.21. <hi>You ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake,</hi> And v. 25. <hi>If they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of his houſhold? q. d.</hi> You muſt expect to be accounted, as very <hi>monſters of men,</hi> nay as <hi>very devils,</hi> if you will be upright with the Lord. So that you have no cauſe to complain of religion, or the wayes of holineſs, when you find your ſelves reproached for them: becauſe it is no more than you were told of, before you entred into that eſtate. As when we fell a commodity in the <hi>market,</hi> that hath ſome defect and imperfection, and we deal openly and plainly with the buyer, giving him information of it, and yet he will have it; If after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he come and complain of it, we are ready to ſay, <hi>Did not I tell you what it was? Have I done you any wrong? Were not you acquainted with it before hand?</hi> So may the Lord ſay unto ſuch as profeſs his name for a while, and at length boggle at his precepts, when they find themſelves reproached: <hi>Friends, I have done you no wrong. Did not I warn you of it before hand, that it would ſurely come thus to paſs?</hi> If you were not reſolved to go through <hi>good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and <hi>evil report,</hi> why did you liſt your ſelves amongſt the number of my followers, when as I took you into my ſervice upon no other terms and covenants? And <hi>pray mark it Sirs,</hi> Chriſt hath forwarned us of reproaches attendant upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106335:49"/>godlineſs, to this very purpoſe, that when we happen to meet with them we might not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him, or his wayes, on that account, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that ye ſhould not be offended. They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues: yea the time cometh that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice. And theſe things they will do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father, nor me. But theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Art thou reproached for following the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and keeping cloſe to him, when the generality of people depart from him? <hi>Why remember how he was reproached for thy ſake, if thou belongeſt unto him; and what revilings he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the ſalvation of thy ſoul.</hi> He was ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for a <hi>glutton,</hi> and a <hi>winebibber,</hi> and one that incouraged profane ſinners in their profanefs: He was accounted a <hi>Witch</hi> and a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> as one that held confederacy with <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the prince of the devils: He was reckoned for a <hi>rebel</hi> and <hi>traytor,</hi> an enemy to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and a <hi>ſeditions murderer</hi> was preferred before him. He was buffered and ſpit upon, and reviled upon every hand: The <hi>Souldiers</hi> reviled him, ſaying, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie who ſmote thee.</hi> The <hi>people</hi> reviled him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs and we will believe.</hi> One of them that ſuffered with him reviled him. And he was put to an <hi>ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,</hi> and <hi>reproachful</hi> death. Was he willing to ſuffer this reproach and diſgrace, for our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and everlaſting advantage, and ſhall we flinch back from him, for fear of ſome <hi>ſcoffs</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106335:25"/>
                  <hi>reproaches,</hi> that we may ſuffer? <hi>Look unto Jeſus,</hi> when this temptation begins to prevail, <hi>fix your eyes upon Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God. For conſider him that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be wearied, and faint in your minds,</hi> Heb. 12. v. 2, 3. See the carriage of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. <hi>They departed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the counſel, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name.</hi> Why for his name? <hi>Why,</hi> becauſe he is the Son of God, and ſo able to recompenſe them plentifully, for any loſs they ſuſtained in his ſervice: He loved them with the moſt affectionate love, and that unto the end: He had ſuffered ſhame for their ſakes, and in order to the carrying on of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The day of judgment, that is at hand, will be a day of revelation as well as of recompence. If you be unjuſtly reproached and ſcandalized now, then you ſhall be cleared, and acquitted, and diſcharged with honour, in the face of all the world.</hi> For as that will be a judicature appointed for the <hi>trying of titles,</hi> ſo for the <hi>clearing</hi> of the people of God from all the <hi>blots</hi> that were caſt upon them, and the <hi>hard ſpeeches</hi> that were vented againſt them. As there will be a <hi>reſurrection of bodies</hi> out of the duſt of the earth, ſo there ſhall be <hi>a reſurrection of the names</hi> of true believers out of that dirt and filth wherein they have been buried. This qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted the ſpirit of S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was cenſured, and ſcandalized, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. <hi>With me it is a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106335:26"/>very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgment: (i. e.</hi> I am little troubled at your cenſures and reproaches) <hi>yea I judge not my own ſelf. For I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts: and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God; i. e.</hi> Then it will be diſcovered, who are praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: The Lord will cauſe the uprightneſs of the upright to appear, and he will vindicate their reputation in the preſence of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The beſt and moſt comfortable way, as much as is poſſible, to avoid reproach and diſgrace, it is, not to joyn in correſpondency with the wicked; but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be exact and circumſpect in your carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wicked, that they may not have ſo much as an occaſion whereupon to bottom an evil report.</hi> As a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> being told that ſome evil minded men did charge him with <hi>ſuch and ſuch</hi> miſcarriages. And I, <hi>anſwered he,</hi> will ſo demean my ſelf, that none ſhall believe them. Here <hi>Sirs,</hi> is an excellent means to prevent reproaches, and a good uſe to be made of them. Do men charge thee with <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>haughtineſs</hi> of ſpirit? Carry thy ſelf with that <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>meekneſs,</hi> that none may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. Art thou cryed out of as a <hi>turbulent, factious,</hi> and <hi>ſeditious,</hi> perſon? Let thy demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our be ſo <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> and <hi>inoffenſive,</hi> that none may give credit to the report. Labour to cut off <hi>occaſion of evil ſpeaking,</hi> from them that <hi>deſire occaſion:</hi> And if notwithſtanding they will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106335:26"/>defame thee, ſtudy to prove them lyars amongſt all with whom thou doſt converſe. And this is the very counſel of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you, as ſtrangers and pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly luſts, which war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſoul. Having your converſation honeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak againſt you, as evil doers, they may by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſitation.</hi> And v. 15. <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> And if nevertheleſs it be your lot to be ſcorned and deſpiſed for your holineſs, then remember for your conſolation, and ſupport; that you have a promiſe of bleſſedneſs, on this very account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If you cannot bear reproaches, for the ſake of Chriſt, and upon the account of holineſs, God may juſtly give you up to the luſts of your own hearts, to fall into ſome horrid, monſtrous, and unheard-of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that you may get a blot upon that account, which ſhall never be wiped out.</hi> If men will not ſuffer <hi>for God,</hi> they may juſtly expect to ſuffer <hi>under the hand of God.</hi> As I have read of a Smith in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes, who was convinced of the truth, and being preſſed by a meſſage from one of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> not to diſſemble his profeſſion but to own it; returned anſwer, <hi>He could not burn:</hi> But within a while it fell out, that his Shop was on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106335:27"/>fire, and was burnt down to the ground, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, as he was endeavouring to quench the fire. <hi>He that could not burn in the cauſe of God, was burnt under the juſt judgments of God.</hi> The like may befal you in the caſe of reproach and revilings: If you cannot bear them, in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the Lord may deliver you over into the hands of the devil, and to be led by your own hearts into ſome deſperately wicked courſes, that you may ſuffer reproach <hi>as the devils Martyrs:</hi> and ſuch reproach as may ſtick by you for ever. And this is none other than what God hath threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened upon ſuch as deſpiſe commandments
<note n="*" place="margin">See this expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah;</hi> He was afraid of being mockt, if he kept the word of the Lord; and by his diſobedience he ſhould be made a Taunt and a by-word. So that the evil he feared came upon him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</note>, that he will make them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, either by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> judgments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Moreover, I will make thee waſte, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach among the Nations that are round about thee, in the ſight of all that paſs by, Jer.</hi> 23.40. <hi>And I will bring an everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon you, and a perpetual ſhame which ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.18, 19.</p>
               <p>So much for the <hi>fifth way</hi> how this temptation prevaileth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sinners are ſoon perſwaded to go down the ſtream with a multitude, in ſin, <hi>Becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould be perſecuted, and oppoſed by them.</hi> They are willing to live at eaſe and quiet, and to ſleep <hi>in a whole skin</hi> (as we are wont to expreſs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106335:27"/>it) and therefore they dare not contradict the generality, leſt they ſhould be ſet againſt by them, and be reduced into ſufferings under their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice. Thus it wrought with thoſe <hi>falſe teachers</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12. <hi>As many as deſire to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, they conſtrain you to be circumciſed: only leſt they ſhould ſuffer perſecution for the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> Mark it, The moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> were eagerly ſet upon the retaining of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> and other ceremonies of the <hi>Moſaical paedagogy;</hi> and they were apt to be violently bent againſt any that went about the abrogation of them. Now theſe <hi>falſe teachers</hi> knew well enough, that all ſuch types were aboliſhed, by the death of Chriſt; but they durſt not own it; ſtill they preached up circumciſion, and forced it upon the practiſe of the converts at <hi>Galatia,</hi> againſt the light and convictions of their own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>What was the reaſon of it? Why,</hi> they knew that if they ſtiffly adhaered to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and waved the <hi>Moſaical ceremonies,</hi> which moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> were zealous for, they ſhould be perſecuted by them: And this was the only reaſon that induced them to comply with the multitude. <hi>My brethren,</hi> you have many that would willingly be the diſciples of Chriſt and his followers, as long as they may do it with ſafety, without endangering their eſtates, or lifes, or their liberties by it: But when they come to take up the Croſs there they faulter. As the rottenneſs, and unſoundneſs, the hypocriſie, and unbelief of the heart is the <hi>fountain</hi> whence <hi>apoſtacy proceeds:</hi> ſo the dayes of tribulation and diſtreſs are the <hi>time of diſcrimination,</hi> when <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106335:28"/>are wont to diſcover themſelves. They can well be contented to make a profeſſion of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to perform ſome of the external du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but they are not able to go through perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. And therefore they keep all things <hi>fair</hi> with the <hi>multitude,</hi> and walk in wayes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them; <hi>leſt if they followed truth and holineſs too cloſe at the heels, it ſhould ſtrike out their teeth:</hi> leſt if they withdrew from the <hi>multitude,</hi> they ſhould be hated and perſecuted by them. For pray <hi>Sirs,</hi> what's the reaſon why the world hates, and ſets againſt the people of God? <hi>Why,</hi> It is for this very thing, becauſe they walk in a way by themſelves, and will not do as the reſt of their neighbours do: they ſeparate themſelves from the generality in their practiſe, and walk more ſtrictly and preciſely, and dare not allow themſelves in ſuch licentious courſes, wherein others live: and ſo their lives are a practical condemnation of the others, and as a corroſive to their conſciences, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: But becauſe you are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Mark it, If believers were of <hi>confederacy</hi> with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if they could <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>revel,</hi> and be <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>wanton,</hi> as others are, and did not take a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent courſe by themſelves, they ſhould be cheriſhed and beloved as well as others: but therefore they are hated, and perſecuted, becauſe they are a ſelect company, and have a <hi>peculiar way</hi> by themſelves. And to eſcape this hatred and perſecution, people are apt to joyn with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106335:28"/>the world, and to walk according to their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and practiſe.</p>
               <p>To abate the edge, and take off the efficacy of <hi>this influence,</hi> let me counſel you to be frequent in the meditation upon theſe <hi>three ſpiritual truths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the everlaſting wrath of God, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the portion of the wicked hereafter, is an evil infinitely beyond all the tribulations and perſecutions that can come upon the godly here.</hi> So that if thou canſt not bear ſome ſharp afflictions for a time, <hi>How wilt thou be able to lye under torments for ever?</hi> If thou dareſt not walk in the wayes of holineſs, for fear of ſome trouble &amp; perſecution from <hi>men,</hi> How wilt thou ſtand under the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> when he will glorifie his power in the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his adverſaries? <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> one of theſe will unavoidably befal you; either you muſt live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus, and then you will ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; or elſe you muſt go down with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, into perdition: either you muſt <hi>through much tribulation</hi> enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or everlaſtingly be ſent into hell torments. And <hi>can you dwell with everlaſting burnings? Are you able to ſtand before the devouring fire?</hi> Lay theſe in the ballance together, and ſee which is to be choſen. Should not a man willingly undergo the greateſt hardſhips upon earth, rather than fal into the damnation of Hell. See how <hi>pathetically</hi> our Saviour preſſeth this very point, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 43, 44. <hi>If thy hand offend thee cut it off:</hi> [that is, mortifie and keep under the moſt <hi>beloved corruption,</hi> deny thy ſelf in the <hi>deareſt enjoyments</hi> thou haſt, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer and undergo the <hi>greateſt troubles,</hi> and the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106335:29"/>ſoreſt diſtreſſes] <hi>It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, then having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that ſhall never be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That even the inward peace and conſolation of the ſpirit, that is to be had in the ways of holineſs, is abundantly to be preferred before that outward quiet and ſafety, which ſinners promiſe themſelves by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the multitude in their wickedneſs.</hi> Shalt thou be thereby freed from perſecutions <hi>without?</hi> But what if God ſend trouble and horrour upon the conſcience <hi>within?</hi> That will be an heavier, and a more inſupportable burden, than all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal calamities whatſoever. It is not the favour and friendſhip of all the men in the world, that can miniſter ſupport and comfort againſt the clamours of an <hi>evil conſcience,</hi> when it is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a wakened by the ſpirit of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity; but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When God doth ſuffer his people to fall into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, for their righteouſneſs ſake, He doth not leave them alone: but hath promiſed himſelf to be graciouſly preſent with them.</hi> He will miniſter <hi>ſtrength</hi> to inable them to bear their burdens: and will dart <hi>comfort</hi> into their ſouls, that ſhall ſweeten the moſt bitter cup of tribulation. He will reſtrain the <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, that they ſhall not lay upon them more than is conducible unto their ſpiritual good: For although God doth ſometimes let his children fall into <hi>the hands of the ungodly,</hi> yet he never delivereth them over <hi>to the will of the ungodly.</hi> At length he will make a way for them to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106335:29"/>eſcape, and cauſe all their ſufferings to work together for their good: and give them an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>recompence,</hi> that ſhall make a plentiful amends, for whatever coſt they have been at in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee: and thorow the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt thorow the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt: neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Iſrael thy Saviour.</hi> And are the conſolations of God ſmall unto you? Is it a light thing to be under the promiſe of his ſpecial preſence, and providence? Wo be to ſinners, when trouble comes from the hand of God, and there is no miniſtration of ſupport from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance of God. <hi>What will they then do in the day of tribulation?</hi> But the Lord will not leave his own people comfortleſs, but will come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and miniſter unto them. This made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that he could rejoyce in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake: for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong, i. e.</hi> when I am at the loweſt ebb of outward enjoyments, then is the Lord pleaſed to communicate the greateſt ſpiritual vigour, and conſolation unto my heart. When my <hi>body</hi> is at the <hi>loweſt,</hi> and my <hi>outward man</hi> at the <hi>weakeſt,</hi> then is <hi>my ſoul</hi> filled with <hi>ſpecial refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> from above. God doth make up the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of my <hi>outward man,</hi> by imparting grace unto, and lifting up the light of his countenance upon, my <hi>inward man;</hi> ſo that I have no cauſe to complain.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:106335:30"/>
               <p>This ſhall ſuffice, to be ſpoken unto the <hi>ſixth way</hi> how this temptation worketh.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And laſtly.</hi> There is a ſecret inclination in mens ſpirits to follow the example of a <hi>multitude</hi> in ſin: <hi>Becauſe it is a pleaſant thing to walk with company; and in competition therewith; the wayes of holineſs and the fear of the Lord, ſeem to be ſad, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, and tedious wayes.</hi> It is a kind of <hi>irkſome</hi> and <hi>unpleaſant</hi> thing for a man to go alone in any courſe; but to walk with company is <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> and ſuitable to a mans heart and ſpirit. Now therefore, to avoid the <hi>lonelineſs</hi> of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, people are ready to comply with the <hi>multitude</hi> of the ungodly. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> argued the caſe with <hi>Samuel</hi> in reſpect of a King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5, 20. <hi>We will be like all the nations, and that our King may judge us.</hi> So are ſinners apt to plead themſelves into wickedneſs: <hi>We cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be ſolitary, and in a path by our ſelves; but let us doe as others doe.</hi> You have a particular <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from S. <hi>Paul</hi> to take heed of this reaſoning, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Therefore let us not ſleep, as do others: but let us watch and beaſober,</hi> intimating, that there is a great proneſs in mens ſpirits, <hi>to do as others do,</hi> and to travel in that road where they may have much company with them.</p>
               <p>Now to ſhew you the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>weakneſs</hi> of this kind of <hi>argumentation,</hi> I will only ſubjoyn theſe <hi>two conſiderations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That a ſound believer, that liveth by faith in Chriſt, and in the exerciſe of repentance, and purifieth himſelf as Chriſt is pure, hath the infinitely bleſſed God, for the man of his counſel, and to bear him fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106335:30"/>in his way.</hi> And is not he <hi>Sirs,</hi> the <hi>beſt companion</hi> in the world? that can give you the beſt help and ſuccour upon every occaſion, and bring the greateſt and moſt heart-warming joy and gladneſs into the ſoul? As the <hi>glory of God</hi> is a believers <hi>ultimate end</hi> at which he aimeth; and as the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> is his <hi>principal guide</hi> by whom he is conducted; and as the <hi>word of the Lord</hi> is the <hi>high-way</hi> wherein he travels; So the <hi>Lord of hoſts himſelf</hi> is his <hi>conſtant companion.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Enoch, He walked with God three hundred years,</hi> Gen. 5.22. <hi>And Noah was a juſt man and perfect in his generations, and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God,</hi> Gen. 6.9. And <hi>my brethren,</hi> can that be a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and melancholy way, where the <hi>God of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> is ever at hand, he that dwelleth in the ſouls of his children, that he may revive their ſpirits? <hi>The truth is,</hi> moſt mens hearts are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſenſual, and they cannot taſt the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of communion with God, or elſe they would not complain for want of ſociety, and fellowſhip. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, as the higheſt priviledg under the ſun, and that in a way of <hi>gloriation,</hi> and boaſting, 1 Jo. 1.3, 4. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe things write we unto you, that your joy may be ful, q. d.</hi> Here is the well-ſpring of joy, here is a ſovereign <hi>antidote</hi> againſt ſadneſs and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latneſs of ſpirit: this will cauſe you to abound in joy, above the joy of <hi>harveſt,</hi> above what will ariſe from the increaſe of <hi>corn</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>oyle.</hi> if you will have your <hi>veſſels filled,</hi> come unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106335:31"/>theſe <hi>waters,</hi> ſecure your intereſt in this bleſſed fellowſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would have the ſociety of men, your fellow creatures, to go along with you; <hi>Why, the wiſeſt courſe to be taken for the attainment of that, is not to comply with the wicked; but to labour what in you lieth, to turn them from their wickedneſs.</hi> So that, be much in <hi>prayer</hi> for them, that God would <hi>open their eyes</hi> and ſhew them the way of truth; that he would <hi>ſanctifie their hearts,</hi> and turn them unto the truth: Set a <hi>good example</hi> before them, that they may be won over by the lovelineſs of your converſations: Deal faithfully with their Souls by <hi>meekneſs of reproof,</hi> and <hi>admonition,</hi> as there is occaſion: Often <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> and <hi>ſtir them up</hi> to follow after righteouſneſs, that ſo they may bear you company in the way to heaven. Let me give you the counſel of the Lord to <hi>Jeremy</hi> in this caſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</hi> But perhaps you will object and ſay, this is the work of a <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Yea, <hi>my brethren,</hi> and it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on every particular Chriſtian alſo, what in them is, to render the wayes of God lovely and amiable in the ſight of others, and to endeavour to win them over, by all means to an effectual cloſure with thoſe wayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. <hi>He that winneth ſouls is wiſe,</hi> Jam. 5.19, 20. <hi>Brethren, if any of you do erre from the truth, and one convert him</hi> [any one, this is a work to be minded by every one of you, without exception] <hi>Let him know, that he which converteth a ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins.</hi> So we are come to the cloſe of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106335:31"/>
                  <hi>ſecond head</hi> of <hi>enquiry,</hi> concerning the <hi>influence</hi> which the practiſe of a <hi>multitude</hi> hath, to encline a man or woman to do evil.</p>

               <p>Qu. 3. <hi>IN what caſes eſpecially, doth it concern us, to be moſt cautious and circumſpect, upon this account, that we be not drawn to evil by the practiſe of a multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>For ſatisfaction to this enquiry,</hi> you muſt well obſerve and remember, <hi>that this caution is needful in every caſe, and doth oblige us to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in every reſpect, to keep a ſtrict eye of jealouſy upon our ſelves at every turn, that we be not inſnared or drawn aſide into ſin by following a multitude.</hi> The counſel is delivered <hi>indefinitely</hi> without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>times, perſons,</hi> or <hi>caſes:</hi> and is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent to an <hi>univerſal prohibition.</hi> For as where the ſpirit of God hath not <hi>added,</hi> we muſt not make <hi>additions;</hi> ſo where he hath not <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,</hi> we muſt not ſet <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>limits,</hi> by a narrowing interpretation. <hi>Thou ſhalt not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a multitude, i. e.</hi> not any multitude, of what ſort ſoever, whereſoever they are, or in what ages or places ſoever they live, in the doing of evil.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs there are ſome <hi>peculiar caſes,</hi> in which this <hi>word</hi> of <hi>advice</hi> doth eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us: wherein we are more than uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, to follow the <hi>multitude,</hi> and therefore ought to be more than ordinarily watchful over
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106335:32"/>our hearts, that they do not turn us aſide upon this temptation. <hi>I will only mention ſix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In caſe of our Anceſtors, and progenitors, that have gone before us.</hi> When our <hi>forefathers</hi> have generally taken any corrupt way, there is a great addictedneſs in their <hi>poſterity</hi> to take the ſame courſe, and there needs a great meaſure of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we be not followers of them. What! <hi>will ſome ſay,</hi> ſhall we condemn our <hi>forefathers,</hi> and judg our ſelves wiſer and better then all that have been before us? they made no ſcruple of <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> actions; they worſhipped God in this, or the other manner; and <hi>ſhall we be more ſcrupulous then they were?</hi> No, we will be for the <hi>old way,</hi> and cleave to that religion, which our fathers were of. This was the argument which the woman of <hi>Sychar</hi> produced, in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Chriſt, to countenance the ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical temple on Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> Joh. 4.20. <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain, and ye ſay, that in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>is the place where men ought to worſhip.</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, whatever <hi>ſcriptures</hi> you may bring, or <hi>reaſons</hi> you may preſs, to keep cloſe to the inſtitution of God, and to worſhip him at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet I am ſure, <hi>Our fathers were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind:</hi> They thought the <hi>punctilio's</hi> of <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and <hi>divine appointment,</hi> were not ſo ſtiffly to be adhered unto: and why ſhould not we do, as our fathers have done? And how hot were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> for maintaining and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>fathers traditions?</hi> though ſome of them were down right <hi>contradictions</hi> againſt, and others corrupt <hi>additions</hi> unto the word of the Lord? See how they plead and quarrel with Chriſt, and his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106335:32"/>diſciples for their <hi>non-conformity</hi> therein, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Then the Phariſees and Scribes asked him, why walk not thy diſciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwaſhen hands? q.d.</hi> This conſtitution we received from our <hi>fathers,</hi> the elders of former generations: and why ſhould not you be concluded by it, and give obedience thereunto? If it had been <hi>a novel, upſtart opinion,</hi> ſomething might be ſaid againſt it: but it hath continued a long time in the Church, even ſince the dayes of our forefathers.</p>
               <p>To ſet you right in this matter, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of this way of <hi>ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> Give me leave to put you in mind of <hi>theſe five things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was one end of the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, wherein all thoſe are ſharers, that are ſaved by him, that he might redeem his people from the vain converſation received by tradition from their fathers: that he might bring them to embrace the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and to give up themſelves entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſubjection to the Law of the Lord.</hi> So that, <hi>mark it Sirs,</hi> Have you an intereſt in the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? would you make it appear that you are reconciled unto God by the ſufferings of his Son? <hi>Why,</hi> this is one way to prove it, <hi>By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the vain traditions of your Fathers,</hi> as far as they are diſſentaneous to the word of God, and have no footing in the word. As Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed God's peculiar people <hi>from the curſe of the Law,</hi> that their perſons might be accepted, and their iniquities forgiven: and as he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <hi>from their bondage unto Satan,</hi> that their natures might be ſanctified, and themſelves ſet
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106335:33"/>apart unto communion with God: So he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them alſo <hi>from the vain practiſes of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that their lives might be ordered according to the Law of the Lord. What can be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and evident? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ye know, that ye were not redeemed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation received by tradition from your fathers. But with the precious bloud of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>One ſpecial reaſon, why the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to give forth the Scriptures, and to leave his will upon record in the Scriptures was this, that we might not pin our faith upon our fathers ſleeves, nor think it enough to do, as our anceſtors have done. Sirs,</hi> If God had intended the <hi>traditions</hi> of <hi>our fathers</hi> as a rule of direction for us, and that they ſhould have been obligatory upon us on all occaſions, he would have left us unto them, and not have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his will by writing in the word. So that take heed left you fruſtrate the grace of God, in ſending the holy Ghoſt to endite the Scriptures, and ſtirring up the Prophets and holy men of God, to be the pen-men thereof, that we might have a certain rule from which we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede. For as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argueth in the caſe of <hi>juſtification. If righteouſneſs came by the moral Law, then there was no need of the death of Chriſt:</hi> the ſame will hold good in caſe of the rule of life, <hi>If the traditions of our fathers were a ſufficient guide, then there was no need of the Scriptures.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall find that the Lord gave forth his <hi>ſtatutes</hi> and <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> as to ſupply the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>light of nature;</hi> ſo to call men off from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106335:33"/>cleaving to the <hi>corruptions of their fathers,</hi> Pſal. 78.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>For he eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and appointed a Law in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded our fathers: that they ſhould make them known to their children. That the generation to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born: who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their children. That they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God; but keep his commandments: And might not be as their Fathers, a ſtubborn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas people are apt to plead for the Religion of their forefathers, and to be in love with it, becauſe of its <hi>antiquity;</hi> that being the <hi>old way,</hi> to which therefore they will adhaere; <hi>You muſt obſerve, That it is not every</hi> old way, <hi>without limitation or exception, that is to be approved, but the</hi> old way <hi>of holineſs, and the fear of the Lord, which ought to be regulated by the word of the Lord; and which becometh vain and ſinful when it is taught ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the traditions of men,</hi> Jer. 6.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſtand ye in the wayes, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi> Mark <hi>Sirs,</hi> It is not every old way that will bring ſpiritual peace, and lead you to everlaſting reſt, but <hi>the good old way.</hi> For moſt damnable corruptions may plead <hi>preſcription of time,</hi> and in ſome ſort their <hi>antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> There is <hi>the old way of ſin and wickedneſs,</hi> which leads directly to the chambers of death, <hi>Job</hi> 22.15, 16, 17. <hi>Hoſt thou not marked the old way, which wicked men have trodden? which were cut down out of time, whoſe foundation was overflown with a flood. Which ſaid unto God, Depart from us, and what can
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106335:34"/>the Almighty do for them?</hi> There is the <hi>old way of ignorance,</hi> and <hi>atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>error,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and <hi>profaneneſs:</hi> There is the <hi>old way of Popery,</hi> with its palpable <hi>blindneſs, blood-thirſtineſs,</hi> and <hi>idolatry.</hi> And indeed <hi>Sirs,</hi> if you will hold to this principle, <hi>To be of the Religion of your forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> you muſt return to the vomit of <hi>Popery</hi> with all its abominations: you muſt wallow in the mire of all their filthineſs, and blaſphemies; or elſe you muſt become <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> For as <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaketh unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Joſ. 24.2. <hi>Your fathers dwelt on the other ſide of the flood of old time, even</hi> Terah <hi>the father of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the father of</hi> Nachor: <hi>and they ſerved other gods.</hi> The like may I ſay to you in this caſe, <hi>Your fathers of old time were Idolaters,</hi> they were drencht in the polluted waters of <hi>Popiſh</hi> darkneſs, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Superſtition:</hi> within the compaſs of <hi>two hundred years,</hi> they worſhipped God in a language they underſtood not; they gave heed to ſeducing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and doctrines of <hi>Daemons;</hi> they gave adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Saints and Angels; nay, they worſhipped bread and wine, and dumb pictures and images. Or if you will go ſome hundreds of years higher into old times; <hi>then your fathers were downright Heathens,</hi> without the knowledge of Chriſt, or of God in Chriſt, that worſhipped and ſerved the <hi>creature</hi> more than the <hi>Creator.</hi> Which then is the <hi>good old way,</hi> that we may walk therein? <hi>Why,</hi> It is the <hi>Scripture-way,</hi> the high-way of holineſs, which God delivered unto his people in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> thoſe ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church, which are of greater an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity than any profane Heathen writings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106335:34"/>
                  <hi>For the prophecy came not, in old time, by the will of man: but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. The good old way, is the <hi>way of the Saints</hi> in the primitive ages of the Church; wherein they travailed towards the kingdom of heaven: the way of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other the ſervants of the moſt-High. And therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> calls them to the <hi>old times,</hi> it was to the <hi>times</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. <hi>For after this manner in the old time, the holy women alſo who truſted in God adorned themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſubjection unto their own husbands. Even as</hi> Sarah <hi>obeyed</hi> Abraham. The good <hi>old</hi> way, <hi>Sirs,</hi> is the <hi>way of righteouſneſs, innocence,</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> obedience to the Law of the Lord, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his will: which can plead its <hi>antiquity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that of ſin, <hi>which is but a novel invention of the devil</hi> (in compariſon) and proceedeth from the vain imagination of mans heart, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made man upright: but they have ſought out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Are you reſolved to be of the Religion of your <hi>fathers,</hi> and to walk in their wayes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have been? <hi>Why,</hi> Remember, <hi>this was the very weapon, with which the unbelieving</hi> Jews <hi>fought againſt the Goſpel.</hi> It was the very argument which they preſſed againſt Chriſt and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the way to heaven which he preached. So that if you had lived in the dayes of Chriſt, you would have perſecuted him, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; and would have oppoſed the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſought to have rooted up the doctrines of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How was <hi>Paul</hi> principled, when he was a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106335:35"/>perſecutor? Why he was zealous againſt any thing that oppoſed the <hi>traditions of his fathers;</hi> And that blind zeal made him mad, againſt the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.11. What had they to object againſt <hi>Stephen</hi> for which he was ſtoned? Why, the principal article of his charge was this, <hi>that he had preached againſt their cuſtoms,</hi> Act. 6.14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This doth mightily enhance and aggravate the ſinfulneſs of a ſin, and tends to ripen the ſinners for deſtruction, when iniquity doth deſcend from one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another; and perſons continue to walk in thoſe evil courſes wherein their fathers have walked.</hi> For we ſhould take warning from them, not to commit the like abominations. Their <hi>evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſhould be our <hi>admonitions,</hi> to keep free from the pollutions wherewith they were defiled. As <hi>hereditary diſeaſes</hi> which come in a blood, and by deſcent from parents to their children, are the moſt <hi>dangerous diſeaſes;</hi> ſo <hi>hereditary ſins</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are the moſt <hi>deſtructive.</hi> Mark how <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> pleads againſt Sabbath-breaking on this account, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.17, 18. <hi>What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this City? yet ye bring more wrath upon</hi> Iſrael, <hi>by profaning the Sabbath-day?</hi> God is wont to ſpare a rebellious people, till the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their iniquities are filled up; and then he ſweeps them away, with the beſom of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. But, <hi>you will ſay,</hi> when is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity like to come to its full? <hi>Why,</hi> when one generation goeth on after another, to ſlight the Majeſty of the Lord, and to trample upon his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106335:35"/>word. Then God will viſit upon ſuch a people their own ſins, and their fathers alſo. He will viſit their iniquity to the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.31, 32. <hi>Ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Fill ye up then the meaſure of your fathers.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.6, 7. <hi>Behold it is written before me, I will not keep ſilence: But will recompenſe, even recompenſe into their boſom, your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together (ſaith the Lord) which have burnt incenſe upon the mountains, and blaſphemed me upon the hills: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will meaſure their former work into their boſom.</hi> So that I may fitly conclude this point with the inſtruction of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> Chap. 1.4. <hi>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have cryed, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Turn ye now from your evil wayes, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> That's the <hi>firſt caſe</hi> wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to uſe abundant circumſpection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In caſe of great men, and mighty men, that are ſet over us.</hi> When <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> turn aſide unto vanities, the people are ready to comply with them. And carnal reaſon is at hand to prompt arguments for it; becauſe this is the way to be countenanced and reſpected by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: Here lieth the plain road to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And herein ſinners think they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for themſelves to juſtifie their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, <hi>Muſt we not obey authority? and ſhall we not ſubmit our ſelves to them that are ſet over us?</hi> Have not they ſouls to ſave as well as we? and if they do thus and thus, why ſhould we be ſo preciſe to

So that, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> there needs ſpecial caution to keep our ſelves pure in this caſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.12. <hi>If a Ruler hearken unto lies, all his ſervants are wicked.</hi> i. e. They will be ſure to ſuit their carriage, in a comportment with his corrupt humour: they will ſeek to ingratiate themſelves, by being like unto him. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and miſcarriages of <hi>private</hi> men are like a <hi>pocket-watch</hi> that goeth falſe, that deceives but one or two: But the ſins of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>great men</hi> are like the ill-going of a <hi>Town-clock</hi> that deceives all the neighbourhood. Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that he did not only ſin himſelf, but <hi>he made Iſrael to ſin alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.34. <hi>How did he make them to ſin?</hi> Well he might force them to ſuffer, but he could not compel them to ſin: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would not be made to ſin by him, whoſe hearts were upright with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but rather left their poſſeſſions and all that they had in <hi>Iſrael. The meaning then is this; Jeroboam,</hi> and his <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Counſellors,</hi> led them the way, and the people were ſoon wrought upon to conform to their example, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ephraim is oppreſſed, and broken in judgment: becauſe he willingly walked after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; i. e.</hi> after the commandment of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> and his Counſellors, whereby the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> was eſtabliſhed, and ſet up. See how the people plead from the practiſe of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and their <hi>forefathers</hi> together, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. <hi>As for the word that thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. But we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incenſe unto the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106335:36"/>unto her; as we have done, we, and our Fathers, our Kings, and our Princes, in the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>q. d.</hi> What doth this man tell us ſo much of the word of the Lord? <hi>Have any of the Rulers obſerved ſuch precepts?</hi> If they have worſhipped the queen of heaven, why may not we do ſo likewiſe? Some Interpreters think the <hi>Text</hi> hath a ſpecial eye upon this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude,</hi>

                  <hi>magnates, the mighty,</hi> ſo they render it; And the word may well take in both <hi>interpretations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To quicken you therefore to <hi>caution</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>conſider:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is the chief governour of the world, who hath an abſolute dominion, and ſupremacy, over all people, and nations: and the greateſt princes, and men in higheſt places upon earth, are but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and ſubſtitutes, and under Officers: they are but our fellow-ſervants in relation to the moſt-High.</hi> So that, <hi>in the firſt place,</hi> we muſt have regard to the voice of the Lord; and reſpect the examples of great men, no further than they are corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to his good pleaſure and will. Let me clear it up to you by a familiar inſtance. If <hi>a King</hi> command me, upon a certain day, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at ſuch a Town; and <hi>a Juſtice of peace</hi> require me at the ſame time to be at another place, far diſtant from it; <hi>whom muſt I herein obey?</hi> You will all conclude, that undoubtedly I muſt obey the <hi>King,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>Supreme,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> is but his <hi>Subſtitute;</hi> and ſo the commands of the <hi>King</hi> do ſuperſede the others injunctions. Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> This is the very caſe: <hi>God is a great King,</hi> the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106335:37"/>
                  <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> have their authority by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> from him: they are his <hi>delegates,</hi> and act under him. So that firſt I muſt give obedience to the word of the Lord, who is the Sovereign. <hi>For the Kingdom is the Lords, and he is the Governour</hi> [the ſupreme Governour, the alone abſolute, and unaccountable Governour] <hi>among the Nations, Pſal.</hi> 22.28. All others are accountable for the exerciſe of their power unto God. This is a point ſo clear, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> durſt appeal to their very judges and adverſaries, concerning it, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you, more than unto God, judge ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though Rulers, and great men, may give thee countenance and preferment upon the earth, yet they cannot ſave thee from the wrath of an incenſed God.</hi> So that, do not provoke God to anger, to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the mightieſt man in the world; for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uphold thee in the day of the Lords indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When perſons would employ us in any dangerous ſervice, we are wont to ſay, <hi>Will you bear me out, and ſtand by me, and ſee that I ſhall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain no damage by it?</hi> Pray <hi>think of it Sirs,</hi> To ſin againſt the Lord is very <hi>dangerous ſervice:</hi> and when thou art venturing upon it, to humour, and comply with great men, conſider whether they are able to bear thee out in it, and can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thy cauſe, when the Lord ariſeth to execute vengeance; whether they can keep thee from being called unto an account at the Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of Chriſt, and ſave thee from everlaſting burnings. <hi>Alas,</hi> they are not able to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>For he accepteth not the perſons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor: for they are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106335:37"/>all the work of his hands,</hi> Job. 34.19. <hi>He ſhall break in pieces mighty men without number, and ſet others in their ſtead,</hi> v. 24, <hi>He ſhall cut off the ſpirit of princes; he is terrible to the kings of the earth,</hi> Pſ. 76.12. So that I will ſhut up this point, with that paſſage of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 29.26. <hi>Many ſeek the Rulers favour, but every mans judgment cometh from the Lord.</hi> Men may think it is a point of <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>policy,</hi> to pleaſe <hi>Rulers,</hi> and to keep in with them, though to the defiling of conſcience, and robbing the Lord of his glory: But in the end it will appear to be groſs <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>ſottiſhneſs:</hi> For it is upon the God of heaven we have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dependance, both for this life, and eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And if God adjudge thee to hell, for thy ſinful compliance; who can reverſe the ſentence, or can be able to deliver thee out of his hands?</p>
               <p>That is <hi>the ſecond caſe</hi> wherein ſpecial caution is required.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In caſe of neer relations, and kindred, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friends and acquaintance.</hi> Their practiſe hath a more than ordinary <hi>attractive</hi> influence. This is a <hi>ſnare of the devil,</hi> wherein many have been taken captive: an <hi>engine</hi> whereby Satan hath drawn abundance to deſtruction. Perſons are apt to plead for themſelves, that they muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it <hi>fairly</hi> and <hi>courteouſly</hi> towards their relations and friends; and hold a familiar correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with them: ſo that if their relations be vain, themſelves muſt be ſo too; and if they be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how ſhould they help it, but that they muſt ſometimes partake with them in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106335:38"/>What would you have us to do, <hi>will they ſay? Would you have us caſt off our deareſt friends, and to ſeparate from our neareſt relations?</hi> This is given as the reaſon of the wickedneſs of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> His relations were ſinners, and he joyned with them: He had contracted <hi>affinity</hi> with a wicked family, and ſo drank of the cup of their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.6. <hi>He</hi> [Jehoram] <hi>walked in the way of the Kings of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>like as did the houſe of</hi> Ahab: <hi>for he had the daughter of</hi> Ahab <hi>to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> And this was one of the reaſons why God did ſo frequently and ſeverely charge his <hi>ancient people,</hi> that they ſhould not make a league, nor joyn themſelves in affinity with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters:</hi> Becauſe he knew it would be a ſtrong <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive,</hi> to carry them into the like courſes: and <hi>woful experience</hi> proved it to be a truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt make no covenant with them, nor ſhew mercy unto thm. Neither ſhalt thou make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with them; thy daughter thou ſhalt not give unto his ſon, nor his daughter ſhalt thou take unto thy ſon. For they will turn away thy ſon from following me, that they may ſerve other gods: ſo will the anger of the Lord be kindled againſt you, and deſtroy thee ſuddenly.</hi> As <hi>godly relations</hi> and acquaintance, that follow after holineſs, may be a means to turn a man unto the Lord; or at leaſt a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to with-hold from open profaneneſs, and profeſſed rebellion againſt the Lord: ſo it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other hand, When moſt of a mans <hi>relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>kindred,</hi> and <hi>acquaintance,</hi> are <hi>evil,</hi> it proveth a ſtrong temptation to lead him unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with them, and to make him ſuch as they are.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106335:38"/>
               <p>Now therefore to fortifie your ſpirits, for the vanquiſhing of this temptation, <hi>let theſe following truths ſink deep into your hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the beſt love you can manifeſt, and the moſt ſignal kindneſs you can ſhew, to your dear friends and relations, is to endeavour to turn them from their ſins; and ſo to be a means of promoting their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the infernal pit of perdition.</hi> And if you will walk humbly and ſeriouſly as in the ſight of God and thereby adorn the doctrine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and put a <hi>luſtre</hi> upon religion, to the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal condemnation of their evil deeds; who knoweth what effect it may have to their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> and conſequently to their <hi>converſion,</hi> and the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of their ſouls? So that here is the queſtion, <hi>Doſt thou love thy relations indeed? Haſt thou an affectionate deſire of the welfare of thy friends? Why,</hi> here is the way to do them the greateſt office of love; by endeavouring to ingage them in the way that leadeth to eternal life. If thou doſt comply with them in ſin, <hi>that</hi> will but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>harden</hi> them, and help them forward to hell: whereas if thou art perfect and upright with the Lord: Peradventure thy counſels and example may win them over to the wayes of holineſs. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the caſe of conjugal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16. <hi>What knoweſt thou, O wife, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt ſave thine husband? Or how knoweſt thou, O man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> The like may I preſs upon you as to all kinds of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>How knoweſt thou, but thou mayeſt be a means to convert thy friends and acquaintance? Or how canſt thou tell but thou mayeſt ſave the ſouls of thy relations, at leaſt of ſome of them?</hi> As thy ſelf art a ſervant
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106335:39"/>of God, ſo thou mayeſt poſſibly bring them into the ſame covenant with the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is no point of incivility and diſcourteouſneſs</hi> (however perſons may call it) <hi>for a man to ſtop his friends or acquaintance in a courſe of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to pull them as firebrands out of the burning.</hi> This I adde, to obviate the vain <hi>objections,</hi> and to prevent the <hi>carnal excuſes</hi> that ſinners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inſiſt upon to ſhift off their duty in this reſpect. Alas, <hi>will they ſay,</hi> would not you have us, to be <hi>courteous</hi> towards them, and to deal <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily</hi> with them? <hi>Why man,</hi> it is the greateſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility</hi> imaginable, for thee to ſee thy friend, or thy brother, or ſome of thy near relations, to be in danger every day of being everlaſtingly undone, and dropping down into hell; and for thee to look on and let them periſh, without ſpeaking a word in order to the prevention; and not to make uſe of any means for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but rather to haſten their eternal ruine and deſtruction. <hi>Put the caſe,</hi> that one of your deareſt friends or neareſt relations were <hi>diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>mad,</hi> and you ſhould ſee him take up a ſword into his hand that he might fall upon it, and deſtroy himſelf: <hi>Would you let him alone,</hi> and ſay; <hi>I am loath to diſturb him, He is my dear friend. and I would not deal uncivily with him?</hi> Or would not you rather make haſt, and ſnatch the weapon away, to prevent his killing? This is <hi>parallel</hi> to the caſe that we are upon. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners are <hi>mad,</hi> and <hi>beſides themſelves,</hi> they have loſt the right uſe of their reaſon, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.3. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in their heart whilſt they live.</hi> And by going
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106335:39"/>on, and continuing, in any courſe of ungodlineſs they do murder and deſtroy their own ſouls. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Ezek. 18.31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart and a new ſpirit: for why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael? q. d.</hi> elſe you will periſh unavoidably, you will die eternally: there is no other way to eſcape the damnation of hell, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death. <hi>And art not thou a hard-hearted wretch, that canſt ſtand by, and behold thy friend mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf, and never ſtep in for his deliverance?</hi> Art not thou a very diſſembler, a <hi>Judas</hi> under the name of a friend, that betrayeſt him with a kiſs: <hi>that is,</hi> that letteſt him deſtroy his ſoul in thy ſight, and wilt not put in thy hand to ſave him, <hi>under the pretence of civility?</hi> It were the part of a <hi>true friend,</hi> to help him, what in thee lieth, out of his miſerable and wretched eſtate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs: and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyle, which ſhall not break my head,</hi> Prov. 27.5, 6. <hi>Open rebuke is better than ſecret love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend: but the kiſſes of an enemy are deceitful.</hi> And what, if they do not ſo account of it at preſent, but take a <hi>loving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> for an <hi>high affront?</hi> Yet <hi>remember,</hi> if the Lord ſhall once bring them to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their ſpiritual eſtate, they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg your faithfulneſs, and love you the better. <hi>For he that rebuketh a man, afterwards ſhall find more favour, than he that flattereth with the tongue,</hi> Prov. 28.23. See the anſwer of the falſe prophets, when reclaimed from their errour
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106335:40"/>
                  <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.6. <hi>And one ſhall ſay unto him, what are theſe wounds in thine hands? Then ſhall be anſwer, thoſe with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friends, q. d.</hi> O, they have dealt <hi>very friendly</hi> with me, I now acknowledge it as an act of <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent kindneſs,</hi> in that they ſtopt me in my courſe, and did not ſuffer, to run headlong into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Be very careful, and prudent, and exceeding wary, in the choice of relations, and acquaintance. Make no friendſhip with evil men:</hi> do not put your ſelves by any contract of marriage, or ſervice, into a wicked family: <hi>make no affinity with a wicked kindred.</hi> Indeed as to <hi>natural</hi> relations, <hi>as that of parents,</hi> or <hi>brethren,</hi> or <hi>ſiſters,</hi> or <hi>the like,</hi> our whole work lieth in a way of <hi>caution:</hi> but as to relations <hi>upon choice,</hi> there is a work to be done by way of <hi>prevention.</hi> And indeed <hi>Sirs,</hi> it is a point of extreme folly, for any perſon whatſoever that would ſave his ſoul, to joyn himſelf, <hi>by way of choice</hi> unto wicked relations. Herein is a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> wherein the <hi>rich</hi> in the world, have a great advantage above <hi>others.</hi> They have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the choice of moſt of an inferiour rank and condition, <hi>in point of marriage:</hi> and with a little more than ordinary coſt, they may have the choice of all in reſpect of <hi>ſervants,</hi> and <hi>attendants.</hi> But their common neglect in improving this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and uſually preferring the traſh and dung of the earth, before holineſs and piety, in the choice of relations, is to me an undeniable practical evidence, <hi>How much this world is ſought after more than the world to come.</hi> Take the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>David</hi> therefore as a copy to write after,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106335:40"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.4, 5, 6. <hi>A froward heart ſhall depart from me; I will not know aw icked perſon. Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me.</hi> And take the <hi>Teſtimonial</hi> of <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malech</hi> concerning <hi>David,</hi> as an incouragement hereunto, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Who is ſo faithful as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid in all thine houſe?</hi> Who will be ſo faithful in their <hi>places</hi> and fill up their <hi>relations</hi> with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to them, ſo <hi>diligently,</hi> and <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly,</hi> as they that are in covenant with God, and have their hearts faſhioned after his heart? From whom can you exſpect ſo much comfort in this life, and ſo much furtherance in ſeeking after eternal life, as from the godly, who dare not wrong you, leſt they ſhould ſin againſt the Lord? And, <hi>on the other ſide,</hi> if you do willingly joyn your ſelves in <hi>affinity,</hi> or <hi>familiarity</hi> with the wicked, juſtly may the Lord give you up to follow their wickedneſs. <hi>For you can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably expect, that God ſhould preſerve you from the commiſſion of ſin, unleſs you ſhun and avoid the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Seriouſly mind the articles of the covenant of peace, and reconciliation; whereupon Chriſt doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll perſons amongſt the number of his diſciples, and doth undertake to conduct them unto the Father. Why,</hi> it is expreſly upon this condition, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>him</hi> rather than their <hi>deereſt relations;</hi> and cleave unto <hi>him,</hi> in all eſtates, though to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rejecting and caſting them off, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>If any man come unto me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> Not as if we were <hi>poſitively to hate</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106335:41"/>for the doctrine of the goſpel, is a great promoter of love: It commands us to love our very enemies, much more our inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate frinds and acquaintance. <hi>But the meaning is this,</hi> if he do not <hi>hate them, i. e.</hi> if he do not love them, in a leſſer degree than he doth Chriſt, which is comparatively a <hi>kind of hatred:</hi> If he be not ready to reject and caſt them off, as we do that which we hate, rather than ſin againſt the Lord, and reject his word: If he do not ſtop his ears againſt their follicitations unto ſin, and ſtand faſt againſt their enticements: If he do not follow <hi>Chriſts</hi> command, and example, rather then <hi>theirs,</hi> when they come in a competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he is but an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> whatſoever profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he maketh. See that ſtrict and ſevere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as to the Sin of idolatry, to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6, 8, 9. <hi>If thy brother, the ſon of thy mother, or thy ſon, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy boſom, or thy friend which is as thine own ſoul, entice thee ſecretly ſaying, let us go and ſerve other gods, which thou haſt not known, thou, nor thy fathers: Thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither ſhall thine eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him. But thou ſhalt ſurely kill him; thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is <hi>the third caſe,</hi> that requires more than ordinary caution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is <hi>in caſe of profeſſours of religion, and ſuch as make a ſhew of godlineſs, and have, or ſeem to have good acquaintance with the Almighty.</hi> People
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106335:49"/>are apt to think, that they are bound to <hi>conform</hi> to their <hi>pattern,</hi> and to ſwallow down whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they embrace, though it be corrupt and lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to juſt exception; eſpecially if they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any <hi>note</hi> and <hi>eminency</hi> in Religion. <hi>Whom may we imitate, if not thoſe that belong to the Lord, and call themſelves his ſervants?</hi> Here is much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being defiled, wherein we ſee ſuch as are accounted <hi>eminent profeſſours</hi> to defile themſelves. <hi>My brethren,</hi> as a <hi>godly man</hi> may fall foully into heinous tranſgreſſions, ſo <hi>a company of profeſſours of godlineſs</hi> may joyn together in ſo doing: And in ſuch a caſe it is an eaſie thing for a man or woman to ſlip <hi>inſenſibly</hi> into the ſame errour, and to be intangled with them in the ſame pollution. For this you have a notable inſtance in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> touching the religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the ceremonial law. When the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews came from <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> they would not eat with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as putting an holineſs in abſtinence from thoſe things wherein Chriſt had purchaſed liberty: And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> and other <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> diſſembled in the matter and joyned with them in their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And when <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſaw ſuch an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man as <hi>Peter</hi> and ſo many godly perſons take that courſe, he was quickly led into the ſame errour with them. And had not S. <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood them boldly, and rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> to the face, and ſtood up in the vindication of Chriſtian liberty, who knows how far the <hi>Gangrene</hi> might have ſpread? <hi>See the hiſtory of it at larg,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 12, 13, 14. They were men of repute for godlineſs, and believed in Jeſus Chriſt; and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106335:50"/>this mightily prevailed upon <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away. And upon this account it is that the <hi>devil</hi> acts moſt powerfully, and doth greateſt miſchief, <hi>by transforming himſelf into an Angel of light, and when his miniſters transform themſelves into the ministers of righteouſneſs.</hi> For he knows, that under <hi>a ſhew of Religion,</hi> and in compliance with them that are <hi>highly eſteemed for godlineſs,</hi> many will be wrought upon to ſuch things as otherwiſe they would abhor, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>To give you ſome <hi>preſervatives</hi> againſt infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on this account, let me take the liberty to ſet before you theſe <hi>three Scripture truths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the examples of the very beſt, and choiceſt of the ſervants of God upon earth, are not abſolute and unqueſtionable rules for the guidance of our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: but they muſt be reduced unto the great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even that of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owned, than they are conformable and conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous thereunto.</hi> He did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: He fulfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without defect, or imperfection: He was a Lamb without ſpot, or blemiſh: and therefore we may be concluded by his pattern. But the moſt eminent Saints have their ſpots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes. <hi>Godly men and women do not alwayes act their godlineſs, but ſometimes vent their corruptions as well as others.</hi> The principle of grace <hi>Sirs</hi> doth alwayes act <hi>like it ſelf,</hi> but a gracious man doth not alwayes act <hi>like himſelf,</hi> Jam. 3.2. <hi>For in many things we offend all.</hi> Eccl. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> So that their examples muſt be tried <hi>by the Law,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:106335:50"/>and the <hi>teſtimony;</hi> they muſt be examined as to their anſwerableneſs to the <hi>great example.</hi> Indeed, in many caſes, the practiſe of the Saints is <hi>a good Expoſitor</hi> of the rule, and ought to be improved as an <hi>argument to quicken us</hi> to live up to the rule of the word of God: but it is not ſufficient of it ſelf to <hi>conſtitute a rule,</hi> nor to <hi>juſtifie</hi> any action that is condemned thereby. And therefore, as we are commanded <hi>in one place</hi> to be followers of the Saints; ſo you have it reſtrained <hi>in another place</hi> with this limitation, <hi>as far as they are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. If a man were tyed up in every thing to follow the example of the godly, he might at ſome times act like the devil, and do that which tends to promote his intereſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.23. <hi>He turned and ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me: for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The very uſe that we ſhould make of the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and miſcarriages of the godly, is not to incourage us to imitation, but to quicken us to the more heedful circumſpection; that we may not fall into their ſins.</hi> Thus ſhould we reaſon with our ſpirits, If <hi>ſuch</hi> or <hi>ſuch</hi> eminent Chriſtians have warped in this point, or the other; what need have we to watch and pray, leſt we ſhould enter into temptation? <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leaſt he fall.</hi> See the pleading of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> from this <hi>Topick,</hi> Neh. 13.25, 26. <hi>Ye ſhall not give your daughters unto their ſons, nor take their daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſons, or for your ſelves. Did not</hi> Solomon <hi>King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſin by theſe things? yet among many
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106335:51"/>Nations was there no King like him, who was be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d of his God, and God made him King over all</hi> Iſrael; <hi>never theleſs, even him did outlandiſh women cauſe to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As a preventive againſt falling by this kind of ſeduction, <hi>be very cautious, that you do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide aſunder into ſects, and parties, in the buſineſs of Religion.</hi> For then this temptation is apt to work more powerfully and prevalently, when we are of a party, and the evil is practiſed by men of the ſame <hi>confederacy</hi> and <hi>perſwaſion</hi> with us. When one Chriſtian is <hi>for Paul,</hi> and another of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and a third of <hi>Cephas:</hi> when believers are crumbled into diviſions, and take upon them <hi>names of diſtinction</hi> and <hi>ſeparation</hi> one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In ſuch a caſe, it is eaſie to be miſled and corrupted. People are apt to ſwallow down the tenents of that party to which they are joyned, without weighing them in the ballance of the ſanctuary; and to write after
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vix dici poteſt quanto libentius imilemur, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus favemus.</hi> Fab.</note> their copy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtioning the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs of it. And <hi>truly Sirs,</hi> there is utterly a fault-amongſt us at this day, concerning this matter. <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> there are many, who would ſeem to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for godlineſs, can give you little or no grounds from the Scripture, for divers things which they maintain and practiſe; <hi>only they take it upon truſt from the men of their way and perſwaſion.</hi> And therefore my counſel is that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. <hi>Call no man</hi> father <hi>upon the earth, for one is your</hi> father <hi>which is in heaven. Neither be ye called</hi> maſters: <hi>for one is your</hi> maſter,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106335:51"/>
                  <hi>even Chriſt.</hi> i. e. Do not build your faith, upon any mans judgment or opinion, but ſearch the Scriptures that you may know what is the mind of God: Do not make <hi>parties</hi> in Religion, nor impoſe upon mens faith, but teach them thoſe things, which I have commanded you. It ſeems to be ſpoken in oppoſition to the corrupt uſage amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were miſerably rent into <hi>Sects,</hi> and were ready to follow, ſome the dictates of one <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and ſome of <hi>another,</hi> who were the <hi>fathers</hi> or <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> of their <hi>Sect.</hi> But <hi>Sirs,</hi> all ſincere Chriſtians are of one ſociety, and have but one <hi>maſter</hi> even Chriſt. <hi>His ſheep hear his voice, and follow him, for they know his voice. But a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they will not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of ſtrangers,</hi> Joh. 10.4, 5.</p>
               <p>So much for <hi>the fourth caſe</hi> that requireth ſuch abundant circumſpection, that we be not inſnared by the example of the <hi>multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth is, <hi>In caſe of men of excellent parts, and learning, and knowledge, above others.</hi> When many of that rank, ſuch as are accounted <hi>wiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, judicious perſons,</hi> ſhall act ſanfully, and turn aſide into crooked wayes; then the <hi>common ſort of people</hi> think they may warrantably tread in the ſame path, when they have men of renown for knowledge, to go before them. Surely, <hi>will they argue,</hi> If there were any hurt in ſuch things, ſo many <hi>learned Doctors</hi> would not approve of them. Shall we be ſo highly conceited of our ſelves, as to think we are wiſer than ſuch great <hi>Scholars,</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the word of God? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeemeth to lie the force of the argument that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106335:52"/>was brought againſt the <hi>officers,</hi> who durſt not lay hands upon Chriſt, becauſe they took him for a Prophet, for that never man, ſpake like him, <hi>Jo.</hi> 7.47, 48, 49. <hi>Then anſwered them the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, are ye alſo deceived? Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him? But this people that knoweth not the law are curſed.</hi> As if they had ſaid, do but obſerve Chriſts followers, and you ſhall find that <hi>generally</hi> they are but a company of <hi>poor, ignorant,</hi> and <hi>illiterate people:</hi> you have hardly one <hi>learned man</hi> amongſt them that owneth him. Do you think that if he were indeed the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would oppoſe him, who are men well skilled in the Law? Would not the <hi>Rulers</hi> cloſe with him? will you be ſo proud and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as to prefer your judgment before theirs?</p>
               <p>To quicken you a little to be <hi>cautious</hi> in this reſpect, there are <hi>four things</hi> worthy to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this behalf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the promiſes for diſcovering the will and mind of the Lord, in reference to matters of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concernment, are not made to men of great parts and learning; but to ſuch as ſerve the Lord in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and integrity of heart.</hi> When a perſon is truly deſirous to fear the name of God, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it his ſtudy and principal deſign to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his conſcience in his ſight; <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> though he be but of meaner parts and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, is in a greater likelihood to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the things concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Niſi fidelium operum uſus praeceſſerit doctrinae cognitio non apprehende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> Hil. in Pſ. 118.</note> 
                  <hi>then the greateſt ſcholars,</hi> that are ſtrangers to the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106335:52"/>grace of the ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? Him he will teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe. And</hi> v. 14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his covenant.</hi> Mark it <hi>Sirs,</hi> it is not much learning <hi>in the head,</hi> but godly ſincerity and the fear of the Lord <hi>in the heart,</hi> that doth entitle us to theſe promiſes of divine teaching. So that this is a poor argument of the <hi>goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> of any way, becauſe many <hi>great ſcholars</hi> and <hi>wiſe men</hi> walk in it. <hi>Beſides,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt is expreſs in this point, that moſt wiſe men after the ſleſh are ſtrangers unto the power of godlineſs, and enemies to the way of ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>For you ſee your calling, brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe: and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things that are mighty.</hi> Some there are of all ſorts that are gathered into the kingdom of Chriſt <hi>(for it is not the condition or ſtate of life, but the conſtitution or frame of the heart, which is the hindrance unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> But there are not many of this ſort, <hi>namely,</hi> of them that are learned and wiſe after the fleſh: The greateſt number of ſuch are uſually adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the truth. See the words of our Saviour in his thankſgiving unto God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Are they men of wiſdom and underſtanding, whoſe examples are pleaded, in oppoſition to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106335:53"/>of Jeſus Chriſt? But how ſhall it be known, whether they are wiſe indeed?</hi> All is not gold, <hi>we ſay,</hi> that makes a glittering ſhew: ſo, All is not true wiſdom that carrieth the face of it, and hath that name and title given to it. <hi>They alone are truly wiſe who keep exactly cloſe to the word of God, and that dare not venture to do what is diſpleaſing in his ſight.</hi> Whatſoever hath a tendency to carry a man in oppoſition to the word, or to cauſe him to reject the law of the Lord of hoſts, is but the <hi>appearance,</hi> and <hi>ſhew</hi> of <hi>wiſdom;</hi> it is indeed the greateſt <hi>madneſs</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi> There are <hi>two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of divine writ for the confirmation of this point, worthy to be wrote on the tables of mens hearts as <hi>in letters of Gold,</hi> and as with the <hi>pen of a Diamond,</hi> that they may never be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated. The firſt is that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Behold I have taught you ſtatutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye ſhould do ſo, in the Land whither ye go to poſſeſſe it. Keep there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and do them, for this is your wiſdom, and your underſtanding in the ſight of the nations, which ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, Surely this great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a wiſe and underſtanding people.</hi> By contempt of the word of Chriſt we provoke to indignation the God of infinite power, againſt whom never man hardened himſelf and proſpered. <hi>And is it not perfect madneſs to ingage him to be our adverſary?</hi> It is a point of the higheſt wiſdom to <hi>keep in</hi> with the moſt high, and to get an intereſt in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? Obedience to the ſtatutes of God hath the promiſe of a bleſſing annexed to it; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is attended with a curſe, that will ſecretly inſinuate it ſelf into all a mans enjoyments, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106335:53"/>eat out the comfort of them. It is by the word of Chriſt you muſt be judged hereafter, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to receive your everlaſting portion; And therefore it muſt needs be an act of the higheſt wiſdom, not to deſpiſe the word, nor to ſet up the dictates of men above the word. The other <hi>text</hi> you have <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.9. <hi>The wiſe men are aſhamed, they are diſmayed and taken. Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſdom is in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God doth many times leave many learned, and wiſe men, unto themſelves, to fall into errours and corruptions, to this very purpoſe, that others may be tried by them, whether they will follow their opinion and judgment, or ſtick faſt to Gods teſtimonies,</hi> Dan. 11.35. <hi>And ſome of them of underſtanding ſhall fall, to try by them.</hi> We read it, <hi>to trie them:</hi> But the words are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ad probandum per illos, to prove others by their example;</hi> They ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſuffered to fall into many ſins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, (for of that ſort of falling it may well be underſtood) that it may be ſeen, who will cleave unto the word of God, rather than to the opinions of learned men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas they were wont to be charged as <hi>proud, arrogant,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceited perſons,</hi> that will not in all things ſubſcribe to the judgments of <hi>learned men;</hi> but ſcruple ſuch things as many <hi>underſtanding judicious</hi> perſons make no bones of: <hi>You muſt remember as to this, that it is rather an act of the greateſt pride and arrogancy in the moſt learned men, to ſet up their dictates in oppoſition to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All that are <hi>truly humble</hi> will ſtoop to his precepts, and ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his guidance and governance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106335:54"/>4. <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſom words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: He is proud, knowing nothing,</hi> Neh. 9.29. <hi>Thou teſtifiedſt againſt them, that thou mighteſt bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkned not unto thy commandments.</hi> Mark it, here are the <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>arrogant</hi> perſons, that think themſelves wiſer than God, and will not ſubmit to his inſtructions and counſels. This is <hi>pride indeed,</hi> and <hi>monſtrous</hi> ſelf-conceitedneſs. And therefore let me cloſe this head with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. In all thy wayes acknowledg him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>laſt caſe</hi> I ſhall mention, wherein eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care is to be taken, leſt we be inſnared by the example of the multitude, <hi>is in caſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the places where we live, and amongſt whom we dwell: and</hi> (that I may comprize them together) <hi>in caſe of the perſons with whom much of our buſineſs lieth in matters of the world, and with whom we often converſe in our ſecular negotiations and affairs.</hi> I joyn them together, becauſe there is a neer <hi>cognation</hi> and <hi>ſimilitude</hi> betwixt them, and the temptation works in both, upon the ſame ground and motive. People are willing to doe, <hi>as their neighbours do:</hi> and to take the ſame courſe, as their <hi>ordinary companions</hi> take, and men of the ſame rank and outward condition with them. Will the <hi>tradeſman</hi> be apt to plead, other men of my profeſſion commonly ſit and tipple at the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106335:54"/>
                  <hi>alehouſe,</hi> and <hi>tavern,</hi> and they ſay, they cannot make a good bargain without it; or they ſhould loſe their cuſtom, except they humour their enſtomers in their luſts; <hi>And why may not I do the ſame?</hi> Others ſay, they cannot live if they ſhould ſpeak the truth in their <hi>markets,</hi> and not take the liberty to diſſemble or lye as to the price of their commodities; <hi>and why ſhould I be more ſtrict than they?</hi> Will the <hi>gentleman</hi> argue, other men of my rank and eſtate ſpend their time in <hi>hawking,</hi> and <hi>hunting,</hi> and <hi>carding,</hi> and <hi>gaming,</hi> and <hi>revelling;</hi> they never think of a <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or how to be ſerviceable to God in their generations; <hi>and why may not I take the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</hi> Moſt in the town and pariſh neglect ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the word, and never pray in their families, nor inſtruct their children, and ſervants; <hi>and what reaſon is there that we ſhould be more preciſe than all the neighbour hood beſides?</hi> As perſons love to be in the common faſhion, as to their <hi>garb</hi> and habit; So in reſpect of their <hi>moral actions</hi> and <hi>behaviour:</hi> So much is clearly implyed in the words of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> cap. 24.15. <hi>If it ſeem evil to you to ſerve the Lord; chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, either the gods which your fathers ſerved, that were on the other ſide of the floud, or the gods of the</hi> Amorites <hi>in whoſe land ye dwell.</hi> He knew, that men are inclined to be of the ſame religion with the people of the place where they dwell, and to conform to the inhabitants of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that are round about them. And therefore the Lord doth warn his people to take heed of the ſins of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> when they ſhould come to dwell in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Deut. 6.10, 11,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106335:55"/>14. <hi>And it ſhall be when the Lord thy God ſhall have brought thee into the land, which he ſware unto thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c. Then beware leſt thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>from the houſe of bondage.</hi> And v. 14. <hi>Ye ſhall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about you, q. d.</hi> You have heard already of their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and perhaps think you abhor them; but the danger will be when you come into their land, and to have your habitations amongſt them: <hi>then you will be apt to do after their cuſtomes.</hi> Now to <hi>fence</hi> you againſt the <hi>prevalence</hi> of this temptation, let me beſeech you to lay to heart <hi>this one particular. That by caſting our lot amongſt evil neighbours, and in the midſt of a wicked people, God doth trie us whether our hearts are ſound in his ſtatutes, or not; and whether we will deal faithfully, or falſly, in his covenant.</hi> And will not you be careful to be found upright, <hi>when you are upon the trial?</hi> If a <hi>maſter</hi> ſhould leave a ſum of money, ſcattered up and down in a room, as if it were neglected; and the <hi>ſervant</hi> knoweth that it is but purpoſely <hi>to trie his honeſty;</hi> and that his maſter hath told it exactly, and knoweth if any be miſſing; only he taketh this way to trie his truth, and fidelity: <hi>Would not the ſervant be very careful and wary in ſuch a caſe, when he knoweth he ſtands upon his trial?</hi> Why <hi>man,</hi> thus it is in this matter. Is thine habitation fixed amongſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity? Doth much of thy buſineſs lye with thoſe that are profane and ungodly? Why, <hi>now thou ſtandeſt upon thy trial,</hi> and God doth order it to be ſo, to this very end, that he may trie thy <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> and the <hi>honeſty of thy heart,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106335:55"/>thou wilt follow his word, or their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. That's a notable text to this purpoſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.1, 4. <hi>Now theſe are the Nations, which the Lord left to prove</hi> Iſrael <hi>by them.</hi> And v. 4. <hi>And they were to prove</hi> Iſrael <hi>by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> God could have drove out all the idolatrous Nations together, and have utterly rooted them up at firſt before the face of his people: But he left ſome to be diſperſed amongſt them. <hi>To what end were they left? Why</hi> to this very end, <hi>that he might try his people,</hi> whether they would cleave unto him, with full purpoſe of heart, or not. So God could gather his Saints together, and deſtroy the wicked from amongſt them: But he leaves them ſcattered up and down in the midſt of the ungodly, and ſurrounded with them on every ſide, to this very purpoſe, <hi>That he may try them, whether they will fear and ſerve him, or be conformed to the wicked amongſt whom they dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is worth your obſerving <hi>by the way,</hi> That there are <hi>three ſorts of providential diſpenſations,</hi> whereby God doth eſpecially ſet his people upon the <hi>trial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By permitting errors, and hereſies to be vented amongſt them:</hi> By ſuffering men to vent their own <hi>corrupt notions,</hi> inſtead of <hi>divine truths;</hi> and to ſet up their own <hi>ſuperſtitious inventions,</hi> in the place of <hi>Chriſts Ordinances.</hi> Theſe are a great trouble and perplexity upon the ſpirits of the godly; and perhaps ſometimes they are apt to wonder, that the Lord doth not take more care of his own worſhip and inſtitutions, but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106335:56"/>them to be defiled with humane devices, and ſinful mixtures. <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> God is jealous of his truth, and worſhip; but he ſuffers theſe <hi>errors,</hi> and <hi>corruptions for a time,</hi> that Profeſſors may be tried, concerning the ſoundneſs of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: whether they will be blown aſide by every wind of doctrine, and be carried by every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence, to follow the fancies of men; or will hold faſt the truth and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>For there muſt be alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among you, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt among you.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument is taken, <hi>from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eſtate wherein moſt perſons are, and the way wherein they travel, or the place whither they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> the greateſt number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are the children of the devil, and lye in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity: they go in the broad way that leads to hell and deſtruction. So that, if you will follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it muſt of neceſſity end in the ruine of your precious, and immortal ſouls. <hi>If you will travel towards heaven, you muſt expect but few to bear you company, and to be of your ſociety, and fellowſhip.</hi> The <hi>multitude</hi> take another courſe, and their journeying tends to another place, even to the chambers of eternal death, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> The whole world] <hi>that is,</hi> the greateſt part of the world, the generality of people: the denomination is given to the <hi>major part.</hi> And will you follow them that lye in wickedneſs?
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106335:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>that are wholly drencht in ſenſuality and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? Is their carriage a good pattern for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that are altogether dead in ſin, and even buried in it? that lye in ſin as in a dead ſleep, and are under the power and command of the prince of darkneſs? This is the <hi>reaſon</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> preſſeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there le which go in thereat: Becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> It amounts to thus much, <hi>as if Chriſt had ſaid,</hi> The whole world is divided into two companies, or ſecieties, and they take different courſes; ſome are travelling towards heaven, but, <hi>alas,</hi> they are but <hi>an handful,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the multitudes that flock together in the way to hell and damnation: Do not you therefore conſort with them, but aſſociate your ſelves with the <hi>little flock,</hi> to whom the Father hath deſigned to give the Kingdom. If your hearts hanker after conſociation, and fellowſhip with the multitude, you will be ſure to find them in the way to eternal perdition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore you ſhould take heed that you be not led by the multitude, <hi>that you may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence your ſelves to be the peculiar people of God, ſuch as are taken into the bond of the Covenant of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with him, and that ſhall everlaſtingly dwell in his preſence.</hi> Which you cannot do if you follow the multitude: for the children of God are a <hi>ſelected company,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>called</hi> and <hi>pickt</hi> out from the <hi>multitude,</hi> that they may drive on other deſigns, and take a way by themſelves. Although
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106335:58"/>believers <hi>are in the world,</hi> yet they are not <hi>of the world;</hi> but a ſpiritual body gathered <hi>out of the world, Joh.</hi> 17.16. <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> Pſal. 14.3. <hi>Know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf.</hi> How are ſuch ſet apart for the enjoyment of God? <hi>Why,</hi> as in the deſignation and fore-appointment of the Father <hi>before time,</hi> ſo he doth ſet them apart <hi>in time,</hi> by the grace of converſion, whereby they are plucked out from amongſt the generality, who are ſtill ſuffered to walk in their own wayes. This is an argument of great ſtrength and efficacy, if rightly managed and improved: And therefore give me leave to open it more diſtinctly <hi>in three Concluſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It concerns us, as we tender our own ſpiritual comfort and welfare, not only to reſign and give up our ſelves to be the Lords, but alſo to make it manifeſt, and evident that we are the Lords: not only to become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly the ſervants of God, but to clear it up to our hearts, that we are indeed his ſervants, and that he hath made with us an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> For herein lies the ſweetneſs of Religion, and that which will put life, and comfort, into every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and providence; when we can aſſure our hearts, that through grace we are beloved of the Lord. Then a perſon <hi>may eat his bread with joy, and drink his wine with a merry heart,</hi> he may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all his enjoyments wiht delight, and paſs through every eſtate without any perplexity or trouble, <hi>when he knoweth, that God hath accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,</hi> Eccl. 9.7. And moreover, the joy ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from this knowledge will wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the heart, and miniſter ſtrength to the ſpirit
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106335:58"/>in running the ſteps of Gods commandments. The love of God when it is thus ſhed abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſouls, will conſtrain us to love him again, and to put forth our utmoſt vigour and might in keeping his ſtatutes. And therefore we are ſo earneſtly called upon, <hi>To make our calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And <hi>to examine our ſelves whether we are in the faith?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſure way to make it evident, without danger of being deceived, that we are the Lords, and that he is our father, is by a ſerious reflecting upon our carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards him, and diligently obſerving the tenour of our converſation before him.</hi> If you would prove that there is <hi>a principle of grace</hi> in your <hi>hearts,</hi> it muſt be <hi>by the exerciſe of grace,</hi> in bringing forth fruits of holineſs in your <hi>lives.</hi> 'Tis by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations Chriſt will judge us <hi>hereafter;</hi> and therefore according to the tenour thereof we muſt paſs ſentence upon our ſelves <hi>here.</hi> That is they way to prevent ſelf-deception, and to put it out of queſtion, that the root of the matter is in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work, and then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another.</hi> And v. 7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To bring the matter home to our purpoſe, <hi>you muſt obſerve, That if your converſation be moulded according to the example of the multitude, and if you walk no otherwiſe than the generality walk,</hi> it will <hi>never conduce to this end:</hi> nor be effectual to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that you are of the number of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>Common practiſes will not be evidential of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace.</hi> It is a ſingularly righteous and <hi>holy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106335:59"/>converſation</hi> that muſt prove you to be partakers of a <hi>ſaving converſion.</hi> If you will make it appear that you are choſen <hi>out of the world</hi> you muſt not be conformed <hi>unto the world.</hi> For the children of God are <hi>a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy nation, and a peculiar people,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
               <p>And therefore take notice <hi>by the way,</hi> that ſuch a converſation, as is evidential of ſaving grace in the heart, and conſequentially of the perſons being tranſlated into the ſtate of grace, muſt have theſe <hi>three poperties.</hi>
               </p>

                  </list> Converſation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It muſt be a ſpiritual converſation, or obedience.</hi> When a man doth the commandments of God <hi>from the heart,</hi> and with the ſoul and ſpirit; out of an awful regard, that is within him, to the majeſty of God; and a conſcientious reſpect unto the law of the Lord. <hi>External duties</hi> may be performed by an <hi>hypocrite;</hi> and are no certain caracters of a ſanctified heart: But they are born of God, who do ingage their very ſpirits to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him. When a perſon doth ſerve the Lord <hi>becauſe he loveth him;</hi> and doth obey his voice <hi>becauſe be delighteth in it:</hi> when he doth act righteouſly in his life, <hi>and his heart goeth along with him in his actions:</hi> Here is the note of an <hi>Iſraelite indeed.</hi> It was this comforted <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſſa. 38.3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It muſt be a ſetled and uniform converſation</hi>

It is not a <hi>fit of affection,</hi> or ſome obedience tendered upon occaſion, when the ſinner is <hi>in a good mood;</hi> that will prove him to be a regenerate perſon: But when he doth wholly dedicate himſelf, and his time, unto the ſervice of God; and bringe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As it is not every <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of ſin,</hi> that will denominate the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending to be an <hi>impenitent ſinner;</hi> except he make it his way and courſe wherein he walketh: So it is not every <hi>particular act of righteouſneſs,</hi> that will beſpeak the perſon performing it <hi>a righteous perſon;</hi> except holineſs be <hi>the high way</hi> where in he walketh, and he take it along with him into all conditions, and companies, into all his concernments and undertakings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep judgment, and he that doth righteouſneſs, at all times.</hi> And <hi>Enoch</hi> had this teſtimony, <hi>that he pleaſed God:</hi> For <hi>he walked with God, three hundred years, i. e.</hi> He was in the fear of the Lord all his life time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It muſt be a ſpecial, or ſingular converſation, ſuch as is differenced from that of the generality of people.</hi> If you walk <hi>as they do,</hi> you will prove your ſelves to be <hi>ſuch as they are.</hi> How ſhall it appear that you are a <hi>peculiar people,</hi> unleſs your demeanour be anſwerable, <hi>i.e. a peculiar demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?</hi> It is upon this condition, that God doth accept of you as his, and maketh over himſelf unto you, <hi>That you do not walk as others walk,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That is the <hi>ſecond argument,</hi> for demonſtration of the doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>third reaſon</hi> that may be preſſed againſt following a multitude in evil, is taken, <hi>from the duties that are incumbent on us in relation unto them, when they ſin againſt the Lord, and do that which is diſpleaſing in his ſight.</hi> There are ſuch duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our hands, as are not only <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with confederating with them, and walking after their example, but <hi>diametrally oppoſite,</hi> and contrary thereunto, as light is to darkneſs. I might inſiſt upon many, but ſhall content my ſelf to inſtance in <hi>theſe four only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is our duty to pity them, and mourn over them, and to take up a lamentation on their account: To make it the grief of our ſpirits, to ſee the name of God diſhonoured, and his ſtatutes contemned, and the bloud of the Lord jeſus deſpiſed, and poor ſouls run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong to deſtruction.</hi> This hath been the carriage of the Saints of God, in times of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and wickedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes: becauſe they keep not thy law.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> was humbled for his own tranſgreſſions, ſo it was an heart-breaking to him, to ſee others tranſgreſs. And ſee how the prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was affected with the ſin and miſery of the diſobedient, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.17. <hi>But if not will not hear it, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places, for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106335:60"/>your pride; and mine eye ſhall weep ſore, and run down with tears, becauſe the Lords flock is carried away captive.</hi> Now theſe compaſſionate work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and godly ſorrow, are a frame of ſpirit, <hi>at a great diſtance from complyance with the ungodly.</hi> And this is one particular that will render us conformable unto our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>maſter:</hi> As he loved his own unto the end, with an inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, everlaſting, and unparallell'd love; ſo his bowels were moved with pity and compaſſion towards his very enemies, that ſet againſt him, becauſe of their folly and the wretched eſtate into which they had plunged themſelves, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, if thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> Mark the ſpeech of Chriſt here, how it is made up of a kind of abrupt expreſſions, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a ſpirit full of affection and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and ſeeking <hi>as it were,</hi> to eaſe it ſelf in a paſſionate lamentation. <hi>If thou hadſt known, q.d.</hi> Alas poor <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> thy deſolation is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>becauſe thou hadſt not known the things that belong unto thy peace.</hi> Well had it been for thee, <hi>if thou hadſt but known them!</hi> Would to God thou hadſt been ſo wiſe, <hi>as to have taken them into thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and conſideration;</hi> that ſo thy calamities might have been averted and prevented! O what a grief is it to my heart, <hi>that thou boſt not known them! So that here is our duty,</hi> if God hath caſt our lot amongſt many wicked, that commit abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in his ſight, we ſhould be ſo far from joyning in a combination with them, that it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106335:61"/>ſhould ſtir up an holy mourning in our ſouls, to ſee them trampling upon the word of God, and lightly eſteeming the rock of our ſalvation. And theſe are the perſons whom, in times of publick judgments, the Lord is pleaſed to ſet <hi>a mark</hi> upon; namely, ſuch as do not only cry out of their own ſins, but are filled with ſorrow for the abominations of the multitude. See it in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> viſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Go thorow the midſt of the City, thorow the midſt of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſet a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi> Set a mark upon them, <hi>i. e. a mark of ſpecial and gracious obſervation,</hi> here are the people that are beloved of the Lord, unto ſuch as theſe he will have reſpect: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly <hi>a mark for ſure deliverance and preſervation;</hi> when others fall at their right hand and at their left, the evil determined ſhall not come near unto them, as it is, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Come not near any man upon whom is the mark.</hi> You know the Angel could do nothing as to the overthrowing of <hi>Sodom,</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was ſecured. <hi>What was he above other men?</hi> See, 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. <hi>And he delivered juſt Lot, vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked: For that righteous man dwelling amongſt them, in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righteous ſoul, from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When others ſin, it is our duty to reprove them, as we have occaſion, and opportunity: and that plainly and faithfully, with chriſtian prudence and diſcretion.</hi> And this is utterly inconſiſtent with following their example

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106335:62"/>we take this courſe, for ſuch profeſſours of religion joyn with us, and ſuch as are accounted godly are men of our confederacy.</hi> It is charged upon the prophets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>they committed adultery, and walked in lies, and ſtrengthened the hands of evil doers, that none did return from his wickedneſs, Jer.</hi> 23.14. How did they ſtrengthen their hands? Not only by their <hi>corrupt doctrine,</hi> and <hi>flattering ſermons;</hi> but alſo by their <hi>wicked lives,</hi> and <hi>converſations.</hi> That did miniſter an argument to the evil doers, whereby to maintain their preſumptuous hopes of ſalvation; and from whence to take incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement not to repent of their abominations. This compliance with ſinners, inſtead of helping to convert them, doth lay a ſtumbling block in their way. And indeed <hi>there is ſcarcely a greater obſtacle in the way of the converſion of the wicked, than the ſinful complyance of carnal profeſſours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is expreſſely required as our duty, in relation to ſinners, to withdraw from them, that they may be aſhamed,</hi> Prov. 1.15. <hi>My ſon walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy feet from their path.</hi> So Prov. 9.6. <hi>Forſake the fooliſh and live; and go in the way of underſtanding,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.14. <hi>And if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> And were this duty but ſtrictly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly practiſed by the body of profeſſours of religion, <hi>to withdraw from ſuch as walk diſorderly,</hi> who knoweth what good effects it might produce unto their <hi>conviction, humiliation,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation?</hi> A remarkable inſtance we have in the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> hiſtories. When <hi>Simeon</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>Perſia</hi> was led to priſon for refuſing to communicate
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106335:62"/>in their idolatrous worſhip; As he was going, there was ſitting at the gate of the Kings Court an old <hi>Eunuch</hi> that had been the Kings Tutour; called <hi>Uſtazares,</hi> once a Chriſtian, but now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from his profeſſion: who ſeeing <hi>Simeon</hi> led by, roſe up and did him reverence: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Simeon</hi> would not ſhew him any reſpect, but turned away from him with indignation, and rebuked him for revolting from the truth. And <hi>what effect had it upon the Eunuchs</hi> ſpirit? <hi>Why,</hi> immediately <hi>Uſthazares</hi> burſt forth into weeping, and laid aſide his rich apparel, and ſitting at the Court gate, he cried out, <hi>Wo is me, with what face ſhall I hereafter look upon God, ſeeing</hi> Simeon <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth to behold me?</hi> and preſently he renounced his idolatry, repented of his former inconſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy, and died a martyr for the faith.</p>
               <p>That's the <hi>third argument</hi> to ſtrengthen the doctrine.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>laſt reaſon,</hi> which I ſhall mention, to diſſuade from following a multitude in ſin, <hi>ſhall be taken from the danger that will ariſe by ſo doing.</hi> If you ſin with them, you muſt expect to be plagued as they are. <hi>If you will eat of their dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you muſt alſo drink of their cup, i. e.</hi> the cup of the Lords indignation, which he hath in ſtore to put into their hands. There is no way in the world to avoid the fury of God, that is to be poured forth upon the wicked, but by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them, and not daring to tread in their ſteps. For the Lord, in the execution of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is no reſpecter of perſons: He dealeth <hi>impartially</hi> and <hi>alike</hi> with all ſorts and conditions.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106335:63"/>He will not ſpare <hi>profeſſours,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>profeſſion,</hi> when he cometh to puniſh the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth: But if their <hi>actions be alike,</hi> they ſhall receive <hi>the like portion</hi> alſo. See what the Lord ſaith to <hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe they turned aſide unto idolatry after <hi>Iſraels</hi> example, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.31. <hi>Thou haſt walked in the way of thy ſiſter, therefore I will give her cup into thine hand.</hi> Nay let me tell you, that profeſs religion, and yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the multitude in evil; <hi>you ſhall receive the greater condemnation:</hi> You will not only be chargeable with <hi>your own perſonal ſins</hi> and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence; but with the <hi>ſins of others,</hi> that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to follow them by your example; and with the <hi>impenitence of others,</hi> wherein they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted through your incouragement. So that if you would be free from a moſt certain and ſore deſtruction; do not ſay <hi>a confederacy</hi> with the multitude in ſin. Some indeed underſtand that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>of a local ſeparation;</hi> but I think it is rather meant of a <hi>ſpiritual ſeparation from Antichriſtian pollutions:</hi> However, if <hi>that</hi> be included, <hi>this</hi> is not excluded: with which <hi>text</hi> I ſhall ſhut up <hi>this head,</hi> Rev. 18.4. <hi>And I heard another voice from heaven, ſaying, Come out of her my people that ye be not partaker of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Information.</hi> There are <hi>three ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial inferences,</hi> that naturally flow from what hath been delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. If a Chriſtian muſt not be led by the example of a <hi>multitude,</hi> but muſt ſtand faſt againſt their <hi>example</hi> and <hi>ſollicitations unto ſin:</hi> then hence it followeth, <hi>That ſuch as are indeed the ſervants of Chriſt, and will walk uprightly with the Lord, in the conſcientious obſervance of his laws and precepts, they muſt of neceſſity be indued with a ſpirit of fortitude and courage.</hi> Why? Becauſe in many caſes they are to withſtand the <hi>multitude;</hi> and to walk in a way, that is oppoſite, and contradictory to <hi>that</hi> of the greateſt number of perſons: and this will never be done, without much courage and reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A man that ſwimmeth againſt the <hi>ſtream,</hi> and the <hi>tide,</hi> and the <hi>wind</hi> together, need to put
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106335:64"/>forth the utmoſt of his ſtrength, and to ſtrike vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly and ſtrenuouſly; or elſe he will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away: <hi>Such is the courſe of every godly man.</hi> He muſt ſwim againſt the <hi>ſtream of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that would carry him headlong into evil, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel: He muſt ſtrive againſt <hi>the wind of ſatanical temptations, and carnal reaſonings;</hi> they would drive him back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>haven</hi> of eaſe and pleaſure, or outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and greatneſs: And then he muſt contend likewiſe againſt <hi>the tide of the multitude,</hi> who come againſt him as ſo many <hi>tempeſtuous waves:</hi> So that if he do not act with all his might, and ſet himſelf with <hi>a full purpoſe of heart,</hi> to hold on his courſe; he will certainly be overborn by the violence of their oppoſition. <hi>A cowardly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> is a contradiction <hi>in adjecto;</hi> for ſuch a man will never be faithful unto God: becauſe he is to bear up againſt the <hi>multitude.</hi> And therefore you ſhall find the Lord preſſing his people to courage on this very account, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.7, 8. <hi>Be ſtrong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work ſhall be rewarded. And when Aſa heard theſe words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin.</hi> Mark, it was a time of <hi>general defection</hi> and <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth exhort them <hi>to be valiant for the truth.</hi> There need to be a good meaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedneſs, in the ſpirit, to ſtand faſt againſt the enticements and provocations of <hi>ſome particular ſinners:</hi> much more when a Chriſtian is to walk in a contrariety <hi>to the moſt,</hi> and hath a <hi>multitude</hi> to conteſt and encounter with, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.4. <hi>Be of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106335:64"/>good courage, and do it,</hi> Joſh. 1.7. <hi>Only be thou ſtrong, and very couragious, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all the law, which Moſes my ſervant commanded thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's the <hi>firſt deduction</hi> from the point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a believer muſt not act after the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the multitude, then hence I gather, <hi>that ſuch as will approve themſelves unto God, and not deal falſly and unfaithfully in the covenant of God, they muſt be men of ſingularity.</hi> As they muſt walk <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,</hi> ſo they muſt walk <hi>ſingularly,</hi> in a way by themſelves: in reſpect to abſtinence from ſin, in regard of purity of heart, and holineſs of life and converſation. They are not permitted a compliance with the greateſt number of men, in any indirect courſe. As in reſpect to the <hi>grace of converſion and ſanctification,</hi> though the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are <hi>in the world,</hi> yet they are not <hi>of the world,</hi> but gathered, and cull'd, and choſen out of it, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.16. So muſt it be in relation to <hi>their practiſe</hi> alſo, though they <hi>abide in the world,</hi> yet they muſt not be <hi>conformed unto the world,</hi> but keep themſelves unſpotted from the pollutions of it. This is <hi>pure religion, and undefiled before God, and the Father,</hi> Jam. 1.27.</p>
               <p>Some there are that plead againſt holineſs, and for the countenancing of their corruptions: <hi>What, would you have us to be ſingular? Muſt we be more preciſe than others, and take a courſe by our ſelves? Why Sirs,</hi> If you will be Chriſtians in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and follow the Lord fully, it is the very thing which God requires and expects at your hands, <hi>that you be men of ſingularity.</hi> For <hi>the Lord hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106335:65"/>ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf,</hi> Pſ. 4.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſegregavit, diviſit, ſigno aliquo excellenti ſeparavit.</hi> He hath put a remarkeable difference betwixt his own people and others, <hi>in reſpect of his bleſſings upon them;</hi> and therefore may juſtly expect that they ſhould be ſingular <hi>in their carriage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not be miſtaken <hi>in this point,</hi> and therefore muſt take liberty to diſtinguiſh of a <hi>threefold ſingularity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>a Fantaſtical ſingularity, in reſpect of opinion:</hi> When perſons have <hi>odde crotchets</hi> and <hi>fancies</hi> of their own, wherein they differ from ſerious, and ſober Chriſtians, in all ages; and in the maintaining of which opinions, they ſometimes exceſſively pride themſelves, as if they had gotten ſome <hi>higher attainments</hi> than the reſt. This is an evil, to which profeſſours of godlineſs, amongſt us, have been hugely addicted, <hi>in theſe latter dayes:</hi> When they have gotten ſome <hi>uncouth notion</hi> or <hi>expreſſion</hi> by the end; they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe its intereſt, and think they are <hi>ſome body</hi> more than ordinary, in the matters of religion. When they have entertained <hi>a peculiar fancy</hi> of their own, contrary to the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of all ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded believers; hereof they will boaſt as of an higher degree of perfection. This ſort of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> commonly proceeds from a mixture of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ignorance.</hi> When perſons have high conceits of themſelves, and in the mean time
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106335:65"/>have little <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>diſtinct</hi> knowledg of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of godlineſs; poſſibly they have ſome <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>broken inſight</hi> into divine truths, but do not underſtand the miſteries of religion <hi>in their combination,</hi> as they are connected and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: In ſuch caſe they are exceeding apt to run into theſe <hi>by-waies</hi> of their own. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeemeth to reduce it unto theſe two heads, viz. <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>ſelf conceitedneſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.3, 4. <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſs: He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words,</hi> &amp;c. In reference hereunto the faith of believers is <hi>the common faith,</hi> Tit. 1.4. <hi>Which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> Jude. 3. Upon this account, we ſhould labour to be of one judgment, <hi>That with one mind, and one mouth, we may glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 15.5, 6. We ſhould be very cautious of eſpouſing any <hi>ſingular notion,</hi> without clear warrant from the word, and conſulting the apprehenſions of godly <hi>miniſters,</hi> and ſerious <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And for prevention of this ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, let every man ſtudy his own weakneſs, and think ſoberly of himſelf, leaſt inſtead of <hi>Juno</hi> he embrace <hi>a cloud;</hi> leaſt in the place of a more <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>refined truth,</hi> he fall into ſome <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſoul-deſtructive errour.</hi> And the rather ought we, <hi>in this caſe,</hi> to give the more earneſt heed; becauſe when weak Chriſtians are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately caught in this ſnare, it is a difficult thing to be delivered out of it. They think it concerns them in point of honour, and as they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106335:66"/>tender their reputation, to juſtifie and maintain the notions which they have avowedly held, and profeſſed: <hi>And this is a ſtrong temptation to a ſetled continuance therein.</hi> And therefore, <hi>I ſay through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think: but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith,</hi> Rom. 12.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>affected ſingularity; as to a mans outward garb and ornaments of the body; as to civil ſalutations and courteous demeanour, and the like.</hi> When perſons make it a part of their Religion, to abſtain from that <hi>decency of habit,</hi> or <hi>geſture,</hi> or <hi>civility of expreſſion,</hi> which is commonly uſed; and delight in this regard to act in a <hi>mode</hi> by themſelves. And <hi>on the other hand,</hi> when others place Religion in uſing ſuch <hi>habits</hi> and <hi>geſtures,</hi> and the like <hi>fooleries,</hi> which God hath not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This is that which renders Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and ridiculous in the eyes of carnal people, and makes them think it is nothing but a kind of <hi>niceneſs,</hi> as to ſuch <hi>toyes</hi> and <hi>trifles.</hi> So the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, neglected the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>judgment, mercy,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> and kept a great ado about <hi>waſhing of pots, and cups, and making broad their phylacteries,</hi> and many other things, which they had received to hold. <hi>They left the commandments of God, to follow the devices and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their own hearts,</hi> Mar. 7.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20, 21, 23. Theſe things may have <hi>a ſhew of wiſdom in will-worſhip;</hi> at leaſt in the fancies of ſome, they <hi>appear</hi> to have it. Here is a fair pretence, of greater ſtrictneſs than the reſt: whereas true
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106335:66"/>wiſdom conſiſts in <hi>fearing the Lord,</hi> and <hi>doing his commandments,</hi> Pſal. 111.10. That wherein the Saints of God differ from the reſt of men, is in the <hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi> in the <hi>unblameableneſs and holineſs of the life;</hi> from whence will flow like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a <hi>ſobriety, moderation,</hi> and <hi>inoffenſiveneſs</hi> in all particulars. <hi>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink</hi> (it doth not conſiſt in conteſts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and animoſities, about ſuch trivial things) <hi>but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt. For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and approved of men,</hi> Rom. 14.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>laſtly,</hi> There is <hi>a ſober ſingularity;</hi> when <hi>men keep themſelves free from the real corruptions of the times, wherein they live; and of the places, and perſons, where their lot is caſt, and with whom they converſe.</hi> When they will not wallow in the filth and mire of the world, nor defile themſelves with the abominations and defilements of the wicked; though in matters <hi>warrantable,</hi> and <hi>not diſſonant to Gods word,</hi> they do as the reſt of men do. In this reſpect, all ſincere Chriſtians muſt be <hi>ſingular;</hi> they muſt not follow a <hi>multitude</hi> to do evil. When others are lukewarm in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, they muſt be <hi>fervent in ſpirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. Whilſt others place their worſhip in <hi>ſhadows</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and a a <hi>pompous outſide</hi> of devotion; they muſt worſhip God <hi>in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4.24. And glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him <hi>both with their bodies and with their ſpirits, which are Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. When others <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>card,</hi> and <hi>dice,</hi> and are <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>wanton;</hi> they muſt ſtudy <hi>to live quiet and peaceable lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2. <hi>To walk honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106335:67"/>as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering &amp; wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying But putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and not making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.13, 14. When others walk <hi>careleſsly,</hi> they muſt be <hi>preciſe and circumſpect,</hi> Eph. 5.15. You muſt not be afraid of being exactly conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in Gods way, or of bearing an awful reſpect to all, <hi>even the leaſt of,</hi> his commandments, for fear of <hi>being ſingular,</hi> or ſo accounted. For that is the way which he hath chalked out for you. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to ſin.</hi> So much for the <hi>ſecond</hi> Inference.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we muſt not follow a multitude to do evil, Then from hence we may draw this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> as an undeniable truth; <hi>That unity, and unanimity, and uniformity, wherein perſons joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with one conſent, and without any diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, is not in all caſes to be commended and approved: but only where they are exerciſed, and as far as they are imployed, in the doing of good.</hi> For if people commit evil in the ſight of the Lord, I muſt not ſin with them for <hi>uniformities</hi> ſake.</p>
               <p>Theſe very expreſſions of <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> have made a great deal of <hi>buſtle</hi> in the world; and they are <hi>engines</hi> whereby poor ignorant ſouls are commonly deluded, and impoſed upon. <hi>Will you break aſunder the unity that ought to be amongſt Chriſtians? You ought to do thus or thus, were it but for uniformities ſake.</hi> Such <hi>fallacious argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are uſually preſſed, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple. Whereas <hi>Sirs, uniformity,</hi> or a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and unanimous agreement is not a matter
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106335:67"/>commendable, in all caſes whatſoever, without limitation or reſtriction: but only ſo far, as the perſons at unity are ingaged in following that which is good. <hi>If they be doing of evil, there muſt be no union or conjunction with them.</hi> We read of as great <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uniformity,</hi> as is lightly imagined amongſt a people that ſet themſelves in open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the moſt-High, and for which very thing the Lord threatned to bring them to utter deſolation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.15, 16, 17. <hi>Then all the men which knew that their wives had burnt incenſe unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods, and all the women that ſtood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>in</hi> Pathros, <hi>anſwered</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>ſaying, As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken to us, in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. But we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incenſe unto the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her; as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Mark it,</hi> Here was a great meaſure of <hi>unity,</hi> and a full conſent and harmony, in their reſolutions, and practiſes. But ſee the <hi>dreadful doom</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are ſentenced, <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27. There is no ſociety of men, but are ſubject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and may be guilty of impoſing ſome things to be believed and practiſed, which are corrupt and ſinful: <hi>And it is utterly impoſſible to prove, that Chriſtianity obligeth a man to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or comply with that which is corrupt and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi> In ſuch caſes, the whole ſtreſs of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie lieth in the proof of the lawfulneſs, and warrantableneſs, of the matter enjoyned and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106335:68"/>practiſed; or elſe an argument from <hi>uniformity,</hi> is of no validity, and will ſignifie nothing at all with judicious perſons. <hi>For we muſt not joyn with the greateſt number, to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little to open this matter more <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> and to clear it up more <hi>fully</hi> to your apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let theſe <hi>four things</hi> be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That unity and uniformity, an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and agreement, are of the number of thoſe things, which borrow their goodneſs or evil, that are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or to be condemned, from the nature and quality of the ſubject, unto which they are annexed.</hi> Juſt as it is in caſe of <hi>forwardneſs</hi> and <hi>activity</hi> of ſpirit: If men are vigorous and active in carrying on a miſchievous deſign, in bring forth the fruits of unrighteouſneſs, <hi>as ſome men commit wickedneſs with both hands, earneſtly;</hi> There <hi>activity of ſpirit</hi> is odious in the ſight of God: But if men be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> and <hi>induſtrious,</hi> about that which is good; then is their <hi>induſtry</hi> worthy of praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The like may be ſaid, in caſe of <hi>unanimity, and general agreement.</hi> As <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> ſpeak of the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> that he hath little diſtinct influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his own, but is <hi>malignant,</hi> or <hi>auſpicious,</hi> according to the nature of the other Planets with which he is in conjunction: So doth <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> accomodate themſelves to the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> about which they are exerciſed. <hi>Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Sirs, will not juſtifie a ſinful action; But it is, the holineſs of the action muſt commend the uniformity.</hi> And therefore it is not a bare <hi>unity,</hi> which the holy Ghoſt preſſeth upon Believers; But <hi>unity of the ſpirit,</hi> when perſons, <hi>with one conſent,</hi> hold the doctrines taught by the ſpirit, and are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106335:68"/>in their ſubjection to the dictates of the ſpirit, and in following the guidance of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If this unity and uniformity be fixed upon, and converſant about, that which is holy and honeſt, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that holineſs, exceeding amiable and lovely.</hi> It puts a <hi>luſtre</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> upon mens fear and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lord; <hi>when they ſerve him with one heart, and in one way:</hi> And helps to prevent manifold miſchiefs and inconveniences, which <hi>diſſenſion</hi> and <hi>multiformity</hi> are apt to introduce into the Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For <hi>difference in worſhip,</hi> is apt to breed <hi>diſtance</hi> and <hi>alienation in affection;</hi> and from thence ariſe <hi>animoſities,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual feuds,</hi> and <hi>perverſe diſputings.</hi> So that I have not a word to ſpeak againſt a Religious uniformity, in that which is excellent, and ſo far as it goeth hand in hand with the divine Inſtitutions and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and doth not intrench upon his royal prerogative, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold how good, and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity!</hi> O the abundant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the communion of Saints! as the <hi>contents of the Pſalm</hi> ſeem to explain that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Let us go into the houſe of the Lord. Our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O</hi> Jeruſalem. Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>is builded as a City, that is compact together. Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the teſtimony of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 42.4. <hi>When I remember theſe things, I pour out my ſoul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the houſe of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106335:69"/>God, with the voice of joy and praiſe, with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them that kept holy-day.</hi> For ſuch <hi>united</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and <hi>combinations</hi> of believers, God hath in ſtore a peculiar bleſſing, and is wont to be amongſt them with his eſpecial favour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>For the Lord loveth the gates of</hi> Sion, <hi>more than all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. And therefore it is mentioned, as one of the great <hi>evangelical</hi> mercies promiſed, to make way for the conveyance of further grace and mercy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>But when a people unite, and joyn together, in what is ſinful; if their uniformity conſiſt in the joynt and unanimous practiſe of ſuperſtition and will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; or in any thing that is contradictious to the Law and commandment of the Lord; In ſuch caſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes exceeding ſinful and deteſtable, and a very great provocation of the wrath of God.</hi> This kind of <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> is nothing elſ but a <hi>grand conſpiracy</hi> againſt the God of heaven; a <hi>cloſely compacted rebellion</hi> againſt the King of Kings. Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and all the <hi>Jews</hi> did uniformly practiſe their <hi>ſuperſtitious waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and other <hi>ceremonious obſervances</hi> received by tradition from the Elders; There were no <hi>Schiſms</hi> or diviſions amongſt them about ſuch matters, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.3. But what ſaith our Saviour in the caſe? See <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>In vain do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</hi> And again, v. 13, 14. <hi>Every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind: And if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106335:69"/>ditch.</hi> Such a kind of <hi>unity,</hi> was that of the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>people,</hi> in their martyring of <hi>Stephen, They ran upon him</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>with one accord,</hi> They were all linkt together in the ſame mind, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.57. And that of the <hi>Kings</hi> of the earth, and <hi>Rulers,</hi> that ſet themſelves, and took counſel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2, 3.

               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, obſerve under this head, <hi>That the only way to ſettle and compaſs, ſuch a kind of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity as is enjoyned of the Lord, and pleaſing unto him, is to keep exactly cloſe to the rule of Gods word, to take heed of making additions thereunto, and not to be wiſe above what is written.</hi> Here is the ready way to prevent <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>diviſions,</hi> and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſunder into <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>parties;</hi> when we keep up to this <hi>one, uniform,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> rule of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>My brethren,</hi> If perſons be guided by <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditton,</hi> and impoſe upon mens conſciences, <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions</hi> and <hi>traditions:</hi> that's a moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign way, to perpetuate Schiſm to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> If perſons will load the ſpirits of their brethren, with their <hi>burdenſom ceremonies,</hi> under whatever pretext of <hi>decency</hi> or <hi>uniformity</hi> they are preſſed: If they will force mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to ſtoop under the weight of their <hi>Canons;</hi> here's a ſure way to cauſe ſeparations, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, without remedy. But if you would indeed attain to ſuch uniformity, as is according to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106335:70"/>mind of God, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Traditions</hi> are multiform, and <hi>Canons of Counſels</hi> are multiform, <hi>vain cuſtoms</hi> urged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious pretences of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> are multiform; and therefore will undoubtedly produce <hi>variance,</hi> and <hi>ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>multiformity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</hi> coming into the worſhip of God, without the ſtamp of divine authority, they want a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>energy</hi> to ſettle the conſcience: there is no firm footing, where a Chriſtian may tread in fuch caſes, without danger, or fear of pricking his feet among bryars and thorns. But the word of God is <hi>uniform,</hi> and at perfect peace with it ſelf, <hi>and layes a ſure foundation whereon to bottom in all ſoul-concernments.</hi> And hereupon muſt you build all your ſuperſtructures, in order to the erecting and ſetting up of <hi>uniformity</hi> amongſt Chriſtians. This is very plain from <hi>former</hi> and <hi>latter</hi> woful experiences. Look into <hi>primitive times;</hi> what a ſtir was there in the Church about the keeping of <hi>Eaſter?</hi> What <hi>tumults, bickerings,</hi> and <hi>heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> both here in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and in many other parts? <hi>Why?</hi> Becauſe they had recourſe to <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and reſted thereupon; and endeavoured to impoſe one upon another, their own private ſentiments and practiſes: whereas the Scriptures would quickly have ended the controverſie. When diviſions were riſen up in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> particularly in the point of the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> what means doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> make uſe of, that the ſtrife might ceaſe? He puts them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the words of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and brings them cloſe to the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>For I have received of the Lord, that which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106335:70"/>alſo I delivered unto you.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. <hi>Mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learnt, and avoid them.</hi> Keep up <hi>Sirs,</hi> to the doctrines of the old and new Teſtament, and let them be the ſtandard of peace and unity.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>All ſorts of perſons are pretenders to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; even ſuch as reſt and pervert it to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> The vileſt hereticks will <hi>Father</hi> their erroneous doctrines upon the word, and profeſs to deduce them from thence. <hi>How then is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we ſhould rationally expect unity and concord in the Church by this means? ſeeing the moſt notorious hereticks will have this pretext; they will ſhelter their monſtrous opinions under the protection, and patronage of the Scriptures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a <hi>trite</hi> objection, <hi>much inſiſted on, by them that are contentious, and of an impoſing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and are loath to be concluded and ſhut up in the exerciſe of their power, within the limits and bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the word of God.</hi> And therefore deſerves to be <hi>anſwered</hi> more largely, than at preſent I can ſpare time to do. All that I ſhall ſpeak unto it, <hi>which yet may ſufficiently diſcover the vanity of this cavil,</hi> I ſhall gather into <hi>five heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There will be hereſies maintained in the Church of Chriſt, amongſt people that call themſelves his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples and ſervants, in all ages unto the end.</hi> It is a matter that will fall out <hi>unavoidably,</hi> and cannot be otherwiſe. As there will be men of <hi>corrupt</hi> lives, <hi>tares mingled with the wheat,</hi> in the kingdom of the Son of man: ſo there will be men of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt notions</hi> and doctrines, that ſpeak perverſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106335:71"/>things to draw away diſciples after them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>For there muſt be alſo hereſies among you, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt among you.</hi> Mark, <hi>It muſt be,</hi> there is a neceſſity of it: <hi>Not a neceſſity of precept,</hi> God is a God of truth, he requires truth in the judgment, as well as integrity in the heart; he calls for ſoundneſs of mind, as well as fervour of affection: But <hi>in reſpect of the event, there is a neceſſity;</hi> it will certainly be ſo: and the Lord hath excellent ends to accompliſh thereby; and therefore will ſuffer errors to be vented and ſpread abroad. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. See alſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30.31. This is no excuſe unto the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>broachers</hi> of any curſed opinions: But it is an uſeful leſſon or <hi>document</hi> for the <hi>ſervants of God,</hi> that they may be quickned to get their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments principled with ſound knowledge, and to beware <hi>leſt they be led aſide from the way, by the errors of the wicked, and ſo fall from their own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs.</hi> That is pertinent on this account, which our Saviour ſpeaketh as to <hi>ſcandals</hi> in general, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Wo unto the world becauſe of offences: For it muſt needs be that offences</hi> [hereſies] <hi>come; but wo to that man by whom the offence</hi> [hereſie] <hi>cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The people of God have no juſt cauſe, to think ever a jot the worſe of Religion and godlineſs, becauſe of the hereſies that ſometimes abound in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> It ſhould rather confirm us in the belief
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106335:71"/>of the truth of the Goſpel: Our Saviour having foretold us that thus it will be, and we ſeeing it verified before our eyes. As the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that no man might be moved by his afflictions, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your ſelves know that we were appointed thereunto,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3. And v. 4. <hi>For verily when we were with you, we told you before that we ſhould ſuffer tribulation, even as it came to paſs, and ye know.</hi> So may I ſpeak in the caſe of <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>hereſies.</hi> Let no man ſtumble, or be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, at the wayes of Chriſt, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Let not your <hi>faith</hi> be weakened, nor your <hi>progreſs in holineſs</hi> retarded, becauſe of theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt opinions, and hereſies; <hi>For your ſelves know, that Chriſt by his Spirit hath foretold of theſe things;</hi> that it muſt come to paſs, as it is in all ages. And he hath therefore warned you of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, leſt you ſhould be offended, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When we ſpeak of unity in Chriſtian fellowſhip, and uniformity in the worſhip and ſervice of God, it muſt not be interpreted of union and combination with ſuch as are hereticks: It muſt not be taken, as if it were meant, that we muſt unite, and go hand in hand with ſuch perſons.</hi> Our Lord Chriſt hath left upon record, ſufficient directions in this caſe, how to purge his Church of ſuch <hi>vermine,</hi> and to keep our ſelves free from the taint of their polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as well as in the caſe of thoſe who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and diſorderly in their converſations. <hi>A man that is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, reject: Knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf,</hi> Tit. 3.10, 11. <hi>From ſuch withdraw thy ſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:106335:72"/>6.3, 4, 5. <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 10. See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 20, 24, 25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then, as to ſound and ſober Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, let this be obſerved: <hi>That the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, which may be a ſufficient ground for their uniting in the worſhip and ſervice of God, are plainly delivered in the Scriptures, and to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eaſily deduced from thence.</hi> They are wrote in legible characters, <hi>that he that runs may read them.</hi> And why ſhould not thoſe things which will declare a man a <hi>ſound believer,</hi> capacitate him for <hi>communion with believers?</hi> Theſe things are written <hi>plainly,</hi> as with the Pen of a diamond; and inculcated <hi>frequently,</hi> that they may be apprenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by the meaneſt of the Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret, in a dark place of the earth.</hi> The oracles of God are not delivered <hi>darkly</hi> and <hi>obſcurely:</hi> they are not folded and wrapt up in <hi>intricate</hi> and <hi>ambiguous</hi> ſentences; as the devils oracles, the anſwers of <hi>falſe gods,</hi> were wont to be delivered, in <hi>caves,</hi> and <hi>grotto's,</hi> and <hi>corners</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground. The truths of God are ſet forth perſpicuouſly. <hi>They are all plain to him that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, and right to them that find knowledge,</hi> Prov. 8.9. <hi>For this commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden, neither is it far off: It is not in heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106335:72"/>thine heart, that thou mayeſt do it.</hi> Indeed, <hi>prating fools</hi> (as the holy Ghoſt calleth them), will ſeek <hi>nodum in ſcirpo;</hi> they will find matter to wrangle with the moſt undeniable principles; But the foundation-truths of Chriſtianity are fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the ears of all within the pale of the Church, that will lend their ears attentively to the ſound of the Goſpel, and will diligently ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy divine myſteries. And the people of God are under precious promiſes of the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to guide them into the knowledge of all neceſſary points, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20, 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12, 14. And why ſhould not thoſe, who are, under the conduct of the ſame truths, in the way of holineſs unto eternal life hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unamimouſly joyn together in the ſervice of God here? <hi>Let us not fall out by the way, for we are brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>As to all other matters, that are more abſtruſe and difficult,</hi> and where in there is a great deal of variety in the interpretation of the Scripture, even amongſt ſober Chriſtians themſelves; <hi>In ſuch caſes, unity and concord muſt be built upon the foundation of forbearance, and mutual tenderneſs of believers one towards another.</hi> If in order to peace and union in the Church, the judgment of ſome that are in power, be ſet up as the <hi>Standard,</hi> unto which the conſciences of the reſt, <hi>in the minuteſt affairs,</hi> are to be reduced; if peace and unity, <hi>I ſay,</hi> depend upon theſe <hi>tickliſh terms,</hi> it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never to be attained whilſt the world endures. <hi>As ſoon may you cut all men to the ſame ſtature, as bring their judgments in all things to the ſame ſize.</hi> But if we would follow after the things that make
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106335:73"/>for peace and unity, <hi>let us with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering forbear one another in love.</hi> Eph. 4.2, 3. Shall not Chriſtians forbear, where the God of heaven is pleaſed to forbear? Sould not we deal tenderly with ſuch, and give them the right hand of fellowſhip, whom God doth tender as the apple of his eye? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. That is an excellent <hi>Rubrick</hi> for direction in the Saints <hi>Liturgy,</hi> Philip. 3.15, 16. <hi>Let us therefore as many as are perfect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheleſs, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the firſt uſe of the point, by way of <hi>information.</hi>

Hath God caſt your lot <hi>in a wicked family,</hi> amongſt <hi>carnal relations,</hi> in times of <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral atheiſm, corruption</hi> and <hi>debauchery?</hi> Labour as <hi>Obadiah,</hi> to fear the Lord greatly; do they entice thee to ſin? <hi>Walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path,</hi> Prov. 1.15. Do they violently and furiouſly rebel againſt the Lord, and make a ſcoffe of godlineſs, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the profeſſours of it?

               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the ground of religion, whereon it is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed.</hi> The generality of people are wont to take up the principles and myſteries of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wholly upon truſt: <hi>They build their faith upon the dictates and opinions of men.</hi> they believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Saviour, and accordingly call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>his ſervants;</hi> they acknowledg <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> ordinances, ought to be attended upon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly lend their <hi>bodily preſence</hi> at them; <hi>and the like:</hi> But if you enquire into the ground and reaſon, why they believe and embrace this way of religion and worſhip; <hi>all they can truly ſay, is,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Miniſter</hi> tells them it is ſo; or their <hi>parents</hi> bred them up in this way: They hold theſe things for truths, for they are points which they have held ever ſince they can remember; <hi>they were of this religion from their very childhood, and infancy; and were brought up in theſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</hi> But do you <hi>my brethren,</hi> build your faith upon the infallible word of the Lord, and get an inſight into the everlaſting goſpel: <hi>Search the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> daily, and diligently, and make uſe of the miniſtry of men to help you to get knowledg of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106335:75"/>the ſcriptures; <hi>that your belief may not reſt upon the bare opinions of men, but upon the mouth of the Lord.</hi> That you may be able to ſay, <hi>not only,</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg theſe doctrines to be divine, and practiſe this and the other duty, becauſe men have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me; But <hi>becauſe I find them contained in the Law of the Lord, and that they are agreeable to his mind, and will: and that herein by the miniſtry I have been inſtructed in that which God himſelf hath revealed, and preſcribed, who is a God of truth and faithfulneſs; upon whoſe living word I bottome my truſt and confidence.</hi> Thus did the noble <hi>Beraeans,</hi> and therefore many of them were converted, and ſavingly wrought upon. They did not take matters <hi>upon truſt,</hi> no not from <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas;</hi> but they would ſee, whether they taught them <hi>faithfully,</hi> what they received from above. And <hi>mark</hi> the note of excellency or <hi>aſterisk</hi> that is ſet by the Holy Ghoſt, upon their heads; and the bleſſed iſſue of their enquiry, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>Theſe were more noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the ſcriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo. Therefore many of them believed.</hi> Do not think it enough, to receive <hi>information</hi> of truth; but examine whether they are <hi>indeed</hi> of <hi>heavenly extraction. Search the Scriptures,</hi> Jo. 5.39. They are appointed of God, to be the ſure <hi>doctrinal foundation,</hi> whereupon our faith is to be bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ye are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may awaken you to <hi>heedfulneſs,</hi> in this regard, let me beſeech you to ſtudy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106335:75"/>throughly theſe <hi>three following conſiderations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If your faith be not bottomed upon a divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, even upon the word of the Lord, it can amount no higher, than an humane faith:</hi> It cannot be a <hi>divine faith,</hi> which receives mattes wholly upon truſt, from the dictates of men. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> the nature of faith is not diverſified <hi>by the quality of the principles</hi> and truths, that are believed; <hi>but by the grounds whereupon,</hi> and <hi>the reaſons why</hi> they are believed. Then is it <hi>an humane faith,</hi> when built upon <hi>humane teſtimony:</hi> and then is it <hi>divine faith,</hi> when the <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is divine,</hi> whereupon credence is given. Elſe a man may receive ſpiritual and ſupernatural truths, <hi>divine doctrines,</hi> by a meer common faith, <hi>an humane faith;</hi> when he taketh them wholly upon truſt from the credit of men. If you would ſee the difference betwixt theſe two, that text is full by way of illuſtration, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.39, 40, 41, 42. <hi>And many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him, for the ſaying of the woman, which teſtified, he told me all that ever I did. And many moe believed becauſe of his own word: And ſaid unto the woman, Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying: for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt the Saviour of the world,</hi> See alſo, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If you do not ſearch into the word, and bottome your belief thereon, you can never be ſtedfaſt and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the wayes of the Lord, nor in any of the truths of religion.</hi> You will be ſtill in a <hi>wavering, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> condition; and in danger to be turned aſide from the faith. <hi>And the reaſon is apparent,</hi> becauſe the dictates of men are <hi>variable,</hi> and <hi>inconſtant.</hi> One man may preſs upon you <hi>this,</hi> as a point to be believed, and another may poſſibly inſtruct you
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106335:76"/>
                  <hi>in the contrary,</hi> as a truth. Nay the ſame perſons at different ſeaſons, may vent doctrines of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature: <hi>To be laid in the ballance, they are altogether lighter than vanity;</hi> And therefore, if you build your faith upon their opinions, you muſt of neceſſity be left at great <hi>uncertainties.</hi> But the word of the Lord is <hi>fixt,</hi> and <hi>permanent,</hi> alwayes <hi>conſonant</hi> and <hi>agreeable unto it ſelf.</hi> There you may reſt as upon a rock that can never be moved. For <hi>every word of God is pure.</hi> Prov. 30.5. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words; as ſilver tried in a furnace of earth purified ſeven times,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. Men are ſubject to <hi>miſtakes</hi> and <hi>errours,</hi> but the word of the Lord <hi>will never deceive you; that</hi> cannot be miſtaken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Unleſs you try doctrines by the rule of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and bottom your faith upon the word of the Lord, you do not give glory to God in believing:</hi> Unleſs you take it upon his word and receive it as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his mouth, you do not give unto God the honour of believing the truth. If you receive the matters of religion, only upon the dictates of men, you rob God of his glory, and give it unto them. For this is a ſpecial part of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and one of the peculiar preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which he doth challeng unto himſelf, <hi>that we give up our judgments abſolutely unto his guidance;</hi> and yield perfect credence unto his word, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.20.21. <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain, and ye ſay that Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to worſhip, Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman believe me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> You are apt to pin your faith upon the ſleeves of your fathers; whereas this is one of the glorious <hi>Royaltie</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106335:76"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Magnus Dei cultus</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. <hi>Magna in Deum blaſphemia,</hi> incredulitas.</note> which appertain unto me, <hi>who am the Chriſt,</hi> to have the abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of your faith: you muſt try the <hi>doctrines</hi> and <hi>practiſes</hi> of your fathers; and all the <hi>opinions</hi> of men, are to be eſtimated, according to their conſonancy unto my word. As <hi>in performance of duty,</hi> we ſhould be careful to give unto God the glory of his <hi>Sovereign authority;</hi> which is, when we do the work of the Lord, becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done by him: So in <hi>our aſſent to the truths of the Goſpel,</hi> we ſhould give unto God the glory <hi>of his truth,</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs:</hi> which is, when we believe what is ſpoken of the Lord, becauſe we know the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> this is the way to give glory to God, when we ſet to our ſeals to the doctrines of godlineſs, <hi>becauſe they proceed from the God of heaven:</hi> believing the things which are written by the Prophets and Apoſtles, thoſe faithful <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> of the Spirit of God, <hi>who ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of being corrupted by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the multitude, <hi>in reſpect of the matter, and ſubſtance of Religion, wherein it is placed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they confine it.</hi> For commonly people are wont to be too narrow and ſhort upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Wherein do the multitude for the moſt part, place their Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106335:77"/>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>I ſhall inſtance only in ſive things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The generality of people place the whole of their Religion, <hi>In the reforming and ordering their lives and actions: But they ſeldom or never think of the neceſſity of ſanctifying their natures.</hi> They ſometimes conſider <hi>what they have done,</hi> but never bethink themſelves <hi>in what ſpiritual ſtate they are.</hi> When their conſciences are a little awakened, and flie in their faces, perhaps they conſider, <hi>for that fit,</hi> what ſins they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and make reſolutions againſt them: But then they proceed no further; <hi>They conſider not at all how to be at peace with God, through the bloud of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor whether they are in Covenant with God by the Mediator of the Covenant.</hi> They mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their lives, to ſtill the clamours of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but few think they muſt be partakers of regenerating grace. Whereas the Law of God is the rule <hi>of our natures,</hi> as well as <hi>of our actions:</hi> It ſhews us what manner of perſons <hi>we ſhould be,</hi> as to habitual principles; as well as <hi>what we ſhould do,</hi> in the right ordering our practiſes. <hi>You cannot poſſibly be ſoved, except you be ſanctified.</hi> So that, be not like unto <hi>the multitude,</hi> in this reſpect. But <hi>examine your ſelves, whether you be in the faith. See whether Jeſus Chriſt be formed in you,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. Be earneſt with God, <hi>to create in you a clean heart,</hi> and <hi>to renew within you a right ſpirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. Firſt endeavour to get into Chriſt, that you may then bring forth acceptable fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto God. Firſt get your natures ſanctified, that you may walk in the wayes of new and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106335:77"/>and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit: for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael!</hi> Conſider, in reference hereunto <hi>three things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the acceptation of a mans actual righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and obediential performances, doth depend upon his ſpiritual eſtate, and the ſanctification of his nature.</hi> Firſt God hath reſpect to the <hi>perſon,</hi> and then to the <hi>duties</hi> practiſed by that perſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. If you remain in the ſtate of nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the work of regeneration wrought within you, though you may do many things <hi>for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which God hath required, yet all you do will be an abomination unto the Lord. For <hi>they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.8. If there be corruptions unmortified <hi>in the perſon,</hi> they will taint and defile the <hi>beſt performances.</hi> For, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.33, 34. <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the tree good, and his fruit good: or elſe make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. O generation of vipers, how can ye being evil, ſpeak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The main enquiry of Jeſus Chriſt, in the day of accounts, will be, into the nature, and quality, of mens ſpiritual ſtate, and condition:</hi> And he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their wayes and converſations, as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their <hi>eſtate.</hi> So that here is the great matter to be ſought after, whether you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or unconverted; whether you are implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Chriſt, or belong to the kingdom of the devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32, 33. <hi>Before him ſhall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106335:78"/>And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Unleſs your ſtate be changed, and your hearts ſanctified and renewed by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>you have no intereſt in the bloud of the Covenant, nor can you plead any title to the death of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the Covenant: whatſoever reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be wrought in your lives.</hi> For it is by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and faith, that perſons are united unto Chriſt, and ingraffed into him: without which there can be no ſaving intereſt in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's the <hi>firſt inſtance,</hi> as to the matter of Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The generality of people confine their Religion <hi>only to ſpiritual exerciſes, and immediate worſhip: But they mind it not in their ſecular affairs, and civil negotiations, and imployments.</hi> They think that Religion lieth only <hi>in hearing the word of God,</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>receiving Sacraments, and the like.</hi> But when they come to their <hi>particular callings,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and the <hi>buſineſſes of this world,</hi> there they conclude they may take their liberty, as being things of another nature, wherein god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is not concerned. <hi>Do not you follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in ſo doing:</hi> But labour to ſet the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. and to intereſt the glory of God, in all your undertakings. Thus <hi>in a meaſure</hi> it will be in the day of converſion, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20. <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106335:78"/>bells of the horſes,</hi> Holineſs unto the Lord: <hi>and the pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea, every pot in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and in</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>ſhall be</hi> Holineſs unto the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>In that day, i. e.</hi> When the Spirit is poured out upon the ſervants of God, Chap. 12.9, 10. When the people are waſhed from their guilt, in the fountain that is ſet open for ſin, and uncleanneſs, Chap. 13.1. Then they will carry themſelves in this ſort, ſo as to intereſt Religion in all their concernments. To this purpoſe remember theſe <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three motives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the word of God, in its directive power and influence, is very extenſive, and exceeding broad.</hi> It reacheth to all the particulars of a mans life and carriage. It is not only a rule for guidance in matters of <hi>worſhip,</hi> but takes in <hi>all our affairs</hi> in this world, within the compaſs of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> How broad is it? <hi>Why,</hi> It is of as great a latitude <hi>on the one hand,</hi> as the corruption of nature is <hi>on the other;</hi> which, <hi>you know,</hi> brings pollution and defilements into all our wayes and affairs: It rides a large cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit; it is of the ſame extent with all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a mans heart; It is of equal latitude and comprehenſiveneſs, as a mans life upon earth. <hi>When thou goeſt, it ſhall lead thee: when thou ſleepeſt, it ſhall keep thee: and when thou awakeſt, it ſhall talk with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Except you intereſt God in your ſecular concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and manage them in obedience to his will, and with a due ſubordination to his glory, How can you comfortably expect his gracious preſence with you, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106335:79"/>his bleſſing upon your affairs?</hi> Wherever you would have God to go with you, <hi>by the influence of his grace,</hi> you muſt ſtudy to walk with God <hi>in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of your graces.</hi> If you would keep under the verge of his merciful <hi>promiſes,</hi> you muſt have a conſcientious regard to his divine <hi>precepts.</hi> You cannot look that the Lord ſhould ſucceed and proſper your buſineſs in the world, to your good; unleſs you manage it in a ſubſerviency to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. <hi>In all thy wayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If you are earthly, and ſenſual, and do not walk with God, in your particular places, and callings, and then think to make it up by duties of worſhip, Such worſhip is deteſtable in his ſight, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived favourably at your hands.</hi> God will reckon all ſuch acts of worſhip, but as the <hi>diſſimulation of hypocrites,</hi> who pretend to love him, but are indeed his enemies, <hi>Jor.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. <hi>Will ye ſteal, and murder, and commit adultery, and ſwear falſely, and burn incenſe unto</hi> Baal, <hi>and walk after other Gods whom ye know not; And come and ſtand before me in this houſe, which is called by my name, and ſay, We are delivered to do all theſe abominations. Is this houſe which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold I have ſeen it, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Do you think by religious exerciſes, and acts of devotion, to expiate the guilt of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous dealings and other crying enormities? <hi>Behold I have ſeen it, ſaith the Lord; i. e.</hi> not only with an eye of <hi>obſervation</hi> and knowledge, but with an eye of <hi>indignation</hi> and fury; I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence your wayes upon your heads. <hi>Brethren, let every man wherein he is called, therein abide with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106335:79"/>God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.24. Let pure Religion, and the fear of the Lord, go with you into your <hi>fields,</hi> and accompany you in your <hi>markets,</hi> and abide with you in your <hi>ſhops,</hi> and be cloſely impacted and interwoven, with all your <hi>civil affairs. As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>ſecond inſtance,</hi> as to the matter of Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The multitude are accuſtomed to place their Religion <hi>only in external performances and outward acts of piety: But they little ſtudy to ingage their hearts and ſpirits in the ſervice of God.</hi> They give him their bodies and outward demeanour; but ſurely, <hi>think they,</hi> our <hi>thoughts are free;</hi> and they heed not to mortifie vile and inordinate affections, provided that they break not forth into any <hi>overt acts</hi> of ungodlineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.2. <hi>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the hearts; q. d.</hi> Men commonly neglect the conſideration of their hearts; they think it enough to mind their outward actions, but little regard the workings of their ſpirits. But ye, <hi>my beloved,</hi> keep your hearts above all keeping: Give unto God your very ſouls and ſpirits, and ſee that <hi>all that is within you</hi> be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his ſervice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all the filthineſs, both of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. And therefore be much in the ſtudy of theſe <hi>three conſiderations</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The greateſt number of tranſgreſſions, whereof ſinners are ordinarily guilty, are ſins of the ſpirit; and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106335:80"/>the moſt heinous impieties keep their reſidence and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation there.</hi> As the heart of man is the curſed principle, <hi>from whence they flow;</hi> ſo it is the ſhop, <hi>where they are forged.</hi> Theſe ſpiritual ſins are the moſt deviliſh wickedneſſes, as carrying the greateſt conformity and reſemblance to the deeds of the Prince of darkneſs. And then, <hi>as I ſaid,</hi> they are ever the greateſt number, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.25. <hi>When he ſpeaketh fair, believe him not: for there are ſeven abominations in his heart.</hi> Seven abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, <hi>i. e.</hi> a multitude of abominations, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes of every kind. For one groſs act of <hi>murder</hi> committed, there is much <hi>hatred,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> which are ſpiritual murder, in the ſight of God. For one <hi>robbery</hi> done, there is abundance of <hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſs.</hi> For one groſs act of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> or <hi>adultery,</hi> there is much ſinful <hi>luſting,</hi> which is adultery in the heart. Now where ſin hath its principal reſidence, there ſhould a Chriſtian be moſt vigilant and careful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God doth judg, and paſs ſentence upon mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, according as the heart is ingaged in them.</hi> So much of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> as is imployed in duty, ſo much <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> in the duty: and ſo much of the <hi>heart</hi> as is ſet upon the commiſſion of a ſin, ſo much <hi>malignity</hi> and <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> is therein, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings,</hi> Jer. 30.21. <hi>Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The God whom we ſerve, and with whom in all concernments we have to do, is ſuch a being as we call a ſpiritual being,</hi> that is, <hi>incorporeal,</hi> and <hi>inviſible.</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:106335:80"/>And therefore bare external acts of obedience carry no proportion, or ſuitableneſs to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and excellencies. That ſervice which is acceptable unto God, muſt have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, an anſwerableneſs unto the nature and perfections of the God, that is ſerved. It muſt be <hi>a walking worthy of the Lord,</hi> Col. 1.10. Now this can never be abſolved by meer outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. <hi>For God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> Jo. 4.24. <hi>We are the circumciſion, who worſhip God in the ſpirit,</hi> Phil. 3.3.</p>
               <p>That's the <hi>third inſtance,</hi> as to the matter of religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moſt perſons limit their religion <hi>to a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and abſtinence from groſſer acts of pollution, and heinous enormities: But they make nothing to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down leſſer impieties, that make no ſuch noiſe in the ears of the world.</hi> Provided they be not <hi>drunkards</hi> and <hi>ſwearers,</hi> and guilty of ſuch other acts of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery;</hi> they think ſome lighter offences are inconſiderable. What if they take liberty, now and then to talk <hi>vainly,</hi> and <hi>frothily,</hi> and <hi>wantonly?</hi> What if they <hi>defraud,</hi> and go beyond their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if it be but in a <hi>ſmall matter,</hi> wherein they receive no great damage or detriment? Surely, <hi>think they,</hi> we need not be ſo exact and preciſe as to theſe things. But, <hi>my brethren,</hi> do not you write after their copy; ſtand you in awe of the leaſt of Gods commandments. Whatſoever is the object <hi>of divine diſpleaſure and indignation,</hi> let it be the object <hi>of your hatred and deteſtation.</hi> Take the prayer of <hi>David</hi> for your pattern, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:106335:81"/>119.133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</hi> Theſe are the perſons whom the Lord hath bleſſed, <hi>Who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled in the way, that walk in the law of the Lord: Theſe alſo do no iniquity: they walk in his wayes,</hi> Pſal. 119.1, 3. Iſa. 56.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Beſides what I have mentioned in this caſe, in the <hi>doctrinal part of this ſubject,</hi> let me give you farther theſe <hi>three particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Leſſer ſins, if they are maintained and allowed, and harboured in the heart; if they are cuſtomarily practiſed in the life, they become, upon that account, exceeding heinous.</hi> The greateſt ſums are made up of <hi>unites;</hi> the vaſteſt mountains are made up of ſmall duſt and gravel, that will crumble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fingers. Smaller iniquities continued in, will bring upon the ſoul a load of guilt, of weight enough to ſink it into the pit of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Is the matter little, wherein thou ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt? and ſo thy tranſgreſſions ſmall <hi>as thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt?</hi> Yet the cuſtom in ſin is no ſmall matter: and perhaps the aggravating circumſtances may be very heinous, when thou ſinneſt againſt light, and knowledg, and under the means of grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>An heart they have exerciſed with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous practiſes; curſed children.</hi> Mark it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vile wretches, <hi>accurſed children,</hi> becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to that which is evil. Hereby ſinners are ſhut up as in a priſon, fettered and manacled that they cannot get free, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian chang his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? Then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Leſſer ſins, as thou accounteſt them, will make
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106335:81"/>way for greater; and ſerve the devil as an engine, whereby to carry ſinners to the moſt horrid abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> You read of the <hi>wiles,</hi> and <hi>methods</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 6.11. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> of the devil. He carrieth on his work of deluding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſouls, <hi>orderly,</hi> and <hi>methodically.</hi> And this is one of his uſual <hi>methods:</hi> He is not wont to tempt men to the heighth of wickedneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but firſt he makes way into the ſoul by ſmaller tranſgreſſions, that he may gradually bring him to comply with greater, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Shun profane and vain bablings, for they will increaſe unto more ungodlineſs,</hi> Prov. 23.31, 32, 33. <hi>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright. At the laſt it biteth like a ſerpent, and ſtingeth like an adder. Thine eyes ſhall behold ſtrange women, and thine heart ſhall utter perverſe things. Tipling</hi> and <hi>drinkings,</hi> will in a while become <hi>drunkeneſs</hi> and <hi>debauchery, wanton words</hi> and <hi>dalliances</hi> will bring forth <hi>adulteries. Forgetfulneſs of God</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, till it grow up into <hi>atheiſm.</hi> He that taketh liberty to allow himſelf in the ſmalleſt impieties, is like one that breaketh up an hedg, whereby an entrance is ſet open, for the whole herd of ungodlineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſmalleſt ſins, if continued in, will bring as certain damnation upon the ſinner, as the greateſt.</hi> Though the deſtruction of heinous ſinners will be <hi>moreſore,</hi> yet the deſtruction of ſuch as live in leſſer tranſgreſſions will be <hi>as ſure</hi> and <hi>unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> For ſalvation and damnation, according to the tenour of the goſpel, do not lie in the <hi>ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106335:82"/>or <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the ſins committed; but in mens <hi>repentance,</hi> or <hi>impenitence</hi> in a courſe of ſin, Mat. 5.19. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of the leaſt of theſe commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Ezek. 18.30. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions; ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's the <hi>fourth inſtance</hi> as to the matter of religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>The generality of people put much of their religion, in the obſerving of places, where the worſhip of God is performed. And they think it doth much adde to the excellency of their worſhip, when it is tendered and diſcharged in ſuch places.</hi> As if that were the main matter to be regarded: They look upon them as <hi>holy places.</hi> They little mind to make evangelical applications unto Jeſus Chriſt, and to get into him; they ſeldom think of putting their offerings into his hands, <hi>who is conſecrated to be our High-Prieſt for ever;</hi> or of preſenting their ſacrifices, by laying them upon that <hi>Goſpel altar,</hi> appointed to ſanctifie all our ſpiritual duties: But if they pray <hi>in ſuch a place,</hi> and hear the word <hi>in ſuch a place,</hi> then they hope their prayers will be acceptable, and their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tend to their ſalvation. I am perſwaded, theſe are apprehenſions rivited in the hearts of the moſt, <hi>That the worſhip of God is far more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing unto God, if performed there, than it is in any other place whatſoever.</hi> But, <hi>my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> be not ye like unto them: But make ſure your intereſt in the righteouſneſs of the Lord
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106335:82"/>Jeſus, and make uſe <hi>in every place</hi> of his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateſhip, and interceſſion; <hi>and then you may come boldly unto the throne of grace, to obtain mercy, and to find grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16. Mark that paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timethy</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</hi> Mind it <hi>Sirs,</hi> It is not ſo much to be regarded, <hi>in what place</hi> you pray, as with what <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> with what <hi>holineſs of heart,</hi> and with what <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> you pour out your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. It is a corrupt <hi>notion</hi> and fancy (a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> fancy) to put holineſs now in the dayes of the goſpel in one place rather than another. It is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> notion. For they make <hi>pilgrimages</hi> for devotion, to this and the other <hi>holy place.</hi> And for my part I am apt to think, that if ever God ſhall pleaſe to ſuffer <hi>Popery</hi> with its <hi>pollutions</hi> and <hi>idolatries</hi> to prevail again in the Nations, out of which it hath been extirpated; this very principle of the <hi>Holineſs of places,</hi> being rivited in the hearts of the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> will contribute no little aſſiſtance, to the <hi>introduction</hi> and <hi>ſettlement</hi> thereof. Now to clear up the truth in this particular, more diſtinctly, let us firſt concede and grant, what is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> granted, in reference to <hi>places of worſhip.</hi> And there are theſe five things muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is not only lawful, but commendable, to appoint and beſtow publike places and buildings upon the Churches of Chriſt, for their attendance upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</hi> Not to render the worſhip <hi>better,</hi> and <hi>more acceptable,</hi> becauſe there performed; but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106335:83"/>for their <hi>commodiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>conveniency</hi> in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereon. It was an act of kindneſs in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> to afford the Church, <hi>a room in his houſe,</hi> for their religious Aſſemblies. <hi>Philem.</hi> 2. Much more is it to erect an edifice, purpoſely to that end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe places and buildings ſo deſigned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, are ordinarily to be preferred before other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; when the worſhip in them performed is according to Chriſts inſtitution, and the people of God joyn unanimouſly together in managing the ſervice of God, according to his will.</hi> Not as if ſuch a place did <hi>meliorate</hi> the worſhip, or contribute any <hi>real, intrinſick</hi> worth thereunto, more than if perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med elſewhere: But only for <hi>convenience ſake</hi> as before. Chriſtians will commonly reſort thither with greater <hi>freedom,</hi> and without thoſe <hi>ſuſpicions</hi> and <hi>jealouſies,</hi> which ſometimes are in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, of being burdenſome to the people, in whoſe <hi>habitations</hi> they convene. And <hi>unbelievers</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>without,</hi> will eaſier be induced to come there, that they may hear the word, and underſtand what is ſpoken <hi>in defence of the doctrines of godlineſs:</hi> who may poſſibly be ſavingly wrought upon, <hi>to converſion,</hi> and carried further than ever was intended by them, through the powerful efficacy of Goſpel Adminiſtrations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In ſuch places, all things requiſite for an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Chriſtians, ought to be fitted and diſpoſed in a ſeemly and decent manner; and ordered to the beſt advantage of the congregation;</hi> That matters may be carried on in a comely way, with leaſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, or cauſe of diſtraction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:106335:83"/>4. <hi>All manner of irreverent, and unſeemly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt be abſtained from in ſuch places, as any way reflect diſhonour, or contempt, upon the worſhip of God, which is there performing or hath been performed; or that may render the place unmeet for religious ſervices afterwards.</hi> Not as if the building were <hi>more holy</hi> than others; but becauſe it is ſinful by any means to caſt diſgrace upon <hi>holy duties;</hi> wherein our buſineſs conſiſteth in attendance upon the <hi>Great King,</hi> the <hi>Lord of hoſts,</hi> whoſe name is dreadful throughout the earth;
<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Jenkins's</hi> Farewell Sermon.</note> and who is a <hi>jealous God, even a conſuming fire,</hi> Deut. 4.24.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, let it be obſerved, <hi>That the opinion of the holineſs of one place above another is, for the moſt part, but a fond conceit that hath obtained amongſt the multitude of the moſt ignorant people;</hi> the tincture of which conceit hath, <hi>not improbably,</hi> continued from the very daies of popery, as their addicted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſome other fopperies hath done. But it is an opinion <hi>exploded</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches.</hi> This is conſpicuouſly evident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves. 1. By the general permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Schoolmaſters</hi> and <hi>Writing Maſters</hi> to teach in ſuch places. 2. By the uſual meetings there about all <hi>Pariſh affairs,</hi> as rating <hi>aſſeſſments,</hi> and giving orders for mending <hi>high-wayes,</hi> and the like. 3. By the publike order for <hi>private dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> to be erected in ſeveral of <hi>ſuch places</hi> in the <hi>great City,</hi> whereby they are converted to civil uſes. For as for the <hi>papalizing doctrines</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious practiſes</hi> of ſome, whereby the vulgar are hardened, in their apprehenſions, being but the <hi>off-ſpring of their own brain,</hi> it is equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <hi>Theſe particulars being premiſed, let me lay down and confirm this plain poſition, further than decency, and conveniency in attendance upon the worſhip of God, there is no manner of holineſſe, now in the dayes of the goſpel, in one place more than another, nor hath one place preheminence above another.</hi> This ſeems to be <hi>covertly</hi> intimated by our Saviour. <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.21, 23.

                     </gap>t the very ſynagogues, or places of publike aſſemblies amongſt the Jews, had nothing of holineſs in them above other places; only they were appointed for

                  <note place="margin">Some think that the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues</hi> were publike places of meeting; as well for <hi>civil,</hi> as ſacred affairs. <hi>Eng.

And therefore you read of <hi>Beating in their Synagogues,</hi> Act. 22.19. And <hi>puniſhing oft in every Synagogue,</hi> Acts 26.11.

I any perſons ſhall ſay that the Jews had two ſorts of Synagogues, one for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and the other for civil aſſemblies; their proof is expected. <hi>Bare unſcriptural aſſertions weigh little in the balance with underſtanding Chriſtians.</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106335:89"/>abhor to ſpend their daies in profaneſs and open abominations, <hi>make little conſcience of ſpending their times in idleneſs:</hi> If they ſhould employ it wickedly in <hi>rioting,</hi> and <hi>luxury,</hi> and ſuch <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate courſes,</hi> they think they ſhould be worthily condemned: But they never regard <hi>the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time,</hi> or the right improvement of it, that it may be <hi>profitably managed,</hi> in the doing, and getting of good. <hi>My brethren,</hi> beware that you tread not in their ſteps. But <hi>ſee that ye walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe: Redeeming the time, becauſe the dayes are evil,</hi> Eph. 5.15, 16.

The reaſon <hi>Sirs</hi> why men are no more <hi>choyce of their time,</hi> is becauſe they are ſo little ſenſible of the <hi>weight and greatneſs of their work.</hi> Did they <hi>conſiderately</hi> mind, how many <hi>ſpiritual leſſons</hi> muſt be learnt, how many <hi>ſtrong corruptions</hi> muſt be mortified, what <hi>variety of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> there are to be faithfully performed, what <hi>ſeveral methods</hi> the devil hath whereby to deceive
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106335:89"/>us in his temptations, that ſhould be carefully enquired into, that he may not get advantage againſt us, together with the <hi>difficulties</hi> attendant upon each of theſe; <hi>would they trifle away their times as if they had nothing to do?</hi> Did we conſult the ſcriptures, and ſee what is expected at our hands in order to eternal life; ſurely we ſhould be ready to anſwer, when our ſinful temper prompts us to ſlothfulneſs, or when any vanities and follies invite us to ſlacken our pace, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> anſwered the adverſaries, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.3. <hi>I am doing a great work, ſo that I cannot come down: Why ſhould the work ceaſe, whilſt I leave it, and come down to you?</hi> I am exerciſing my ſelf in <hi>a buſy buſineſs,</hi> of everlaſting weight and moment, and it infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely concerns me not to do it <hi>by halfes,</hi> or leave it unfiniſhed, and unperfected; even in laying up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, that I may lay hold upon eternal life: <hi>Why ſhould the work ceaſe, whilſt I ſpend my time in trifles?</hi> I have not an hour to ſpare, that may be paſſed away in idleneſs and negligence; in doing nothing or what is as good as nothing.</p>

For when men take liberty to ſpend their time <hi>in idleneſs,</hi> and make no conſcience of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106335:90"/>laying it out, to the ends for which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it, they will ſoon be wrought upon to ſpend it <hi>wickedly.</hi> Through idleneſs and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs (or that which is <hi>tantamount</hi>) vain delights and fooleries, ſinners are obnoxious and expoſed to all Satanica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This is one of the Talents, for which you are ſtrictly accountable, at the great and notable day of the Lord,</hi> viz. <hi>All the time of your continuance upon the face of the earth.

(2) <hi>The diſciples of Chriſt</hi> (unto whom he gave this counſel privately, and apart by themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.3.) <hi>before this time of their flight kept their aſſemblies wholly apart from the Jewes. and kept the Lords day, the firſt day of the week; having altogether coſt off the Jewiſh ſabbath:</hi> whence we may conclude, that theſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are meant not of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſabbath,</hi> wherein his own people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Indeed ſometimes we meet, in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> with mention made of the <hi>ſeventh day ſabbath:</hi> The Apoſtles taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that day, to preach to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> but we never find it mentioned after that meeting at <hi>Troas, Act.</hi> 20.7. So that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106335:94"/>long before the time of their flight, they wholly withdrew from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and kept their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ſeparated by themſelves, <hi>on the Lords day.</hi> (3) <hi>It was an ordinary thing with our Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death and paſſion, to inſtruct his diſciples, in many divine truths, which they did not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand till after his reſurrection, or aſcenſion:</hi> When the Holy Ghoſt was ſent to that end, to bring his words to their <hi>remembrance,</hi> and to teach them the right meaning of the ſame. See, <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>Jo.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.44, 45. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44, 45, 46. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.15, 16. <hi>This,</hi> if well obſerved, will take off the force of their <hi>objection,</hi> who plead that Chriſts words muſt needs be meant of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſay they,</hi> his diſciples undoubtedly ſo underſtood them. This I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg <hi>as probable,</hi> that they took his ſpeech, as meant of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> when yet our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath:</hi> It being uſual with him to deliver many things unto them, which they did not rightly underſtand, till he was riſen from the dead. Probably this very buſineſs of the <hi>alteration of the Sabbath,</hi> was one of the things which he had to ſay unto them, but they could not then bear them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.12. And one of thoſe many things, <hi>touching the kingdom of God,</hi> which he taught them between his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3.

Chriſt bids his diſciples pray, that their viſitation be not on the Sabbath day:

                  <q>Chriſt ſpeaking of thoſe dayes, when all the ceremonial law was dead and buried, ſheweth the Sabbath to ſtand ſtill,</q> quoting for it this text. Take the concurrent teſtimony of A. B. <hi>Uſher.</hi> 
                  <q>Our Saviour Chriſt willing his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that ſhould live about 40. years after his aſcenſion, <hi>to pray that their flight might not be on the Sabbath day,</hi> to the end they might not be hindred in the ſervice of God, doth thereby ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare, that he held not this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in the account of a ceremony.</q> And laſtly (which may abundantly ſhew that it is <hi>not any novel interpretation</hi>) Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> give this <hi>paraphraſe</hi> upon the words. <q>
                     <hi>As if Chriſt ſaid, unto his diſciples,</hi> the Jews have charged me as a breaker of the Sabbath; but whatever diſputes and reaſonings you have heard betwixt me and them, concerning that ſubject, I would not have you to think, that I am an enemy to the Sabbath, or that I mean to put an end to that commandment: For I tell you there ſhall ſtill remain <hi>a Sabbath day</hi> to be obſerved to God for his worſhip.

               <p>It is of this day, and the reſt of it, which the text I am opening is to bemeant: <hi>And what day is that, in the times of the goſpel, but the Chriſtian Sabbath?</hi> There is not to be met with any other day, wherein the Saints can be ſuppoſed, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> to exhort and quicken each other unto the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. <hi>The other ſix dayes are appointed for labour.</hi> (4) A believers perſonal reſt into which he enters by faith, was enjoyed by the Saints in the times of the old Teſtament; <hi>For they were ſaved by the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even as we:</hi> But the Apoſtle treateth here, out of the words of <hi>David,</hi> of a reſt or Sabbath to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a long time after, <hi>even in the daies of the New Teſtament</hi> for that <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a propheſy of <hi>evangelical</hi> diſpenſations. <hi>As it is ſaid in</hi> David, <hi>to day, after ſo long a time.</hi> By the <hi>ſame reaſon</hi> that the Apoſtle proveth, that this day of reſt muſt not be meant of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> becauſe that was inſtituted from the beginning of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. We may prove, it is not meant primarily of a <hi>believers perſonal reſt by faith,</hi> becauſe that was enjoyed by the Saints in all ages of the Church, before the dayes of <hi>David:</hi> But here he prophecieth of a priviledg, that was to be conferred on the people of Chriſt, <hi>a long time after,</hi> (5) The Apoſtle is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

This is juſtly attributable unto <hi>Chriſts work of redemption;</hi> but cannot ſo fitly be applyed unto the <hi>Saints: When they ceaſe from ſin, behold it appeareth unto them exceeding evil, and bitter,</hi> and they are filled thereupon with godly ſhame and ſelf abhorrence <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 29, 31. <hi>Beſides</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh afterwards, <hi>of Chriſts paſſing into the heavens,</hi> as relating to ſomewhat that had been before delivered.

How many <hi>unexpected providences</hi> are the children of men ſubject to, that may take us away in an inſtant? So that <hi>man knoweth not his time, as the fiſhes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the ſnare, ſo are the ſons of men
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106335:101"/>ſnared in an evil time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them.</hi> How many <hi>hidden diſeaſes</hi> may lie lurking in the body, and <hi>inclinations</hi> unto diſeaſes <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, impoſtumations,</hi> and <hi>the like,</hi> which may break forth as in the <hi>twinkling of an eye,</hi> and carry the ſinner irrecoverably to his long home? And then where is the promiſe of his repenting hereafter? <hi>Go to now ye that ſay, to morrow or the next day,</hi> when this buſineſs is over, or the other ſeaſon is come, <hi>we will return to the Lord,</hi> and be reconciled to him. <hi>Whereas you know not what ſhall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even as a vapour, that appeareth for a little time and then vaniſheth away,</hi> Jam. 4.14. The time to come is <hi>Gods</hi> to diſpoſe of, and he hath allotted only the preſent to make ſure of our ſalvation. 2. <hi>The preſent time is the ſeaſon which alone hath the promiſe of acceptation.

And it is to be feared that this is the caſe of the multitude. For my part, <hi>I know not one paſſage of ſcripture, whereupon a ſinner, that liveth under the means of grace, and being convinced of the neceſſity of repentance, ſhall break through thoſe convictions, and put it off till hereafter, can bottom the leaſt comfortable hopes, that his future repentance will be ſincere and ſaving:</hi> But there are many places, from which he may have juſt cauſe to fear the contrary. <hi>Qualis vita, finis ità.</hi> Commonly as wicked men live, ſo they die, and periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſaving change upon their hearts: and their <hi>death-bed repentings</hi> prove but hypocritical and rotten, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.8, 9. <hi>For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul? Will God hear his cry, when trouble cometh upon him? i. e.</hi> It will not be ſuch a cry, as God will have any gracious regard unto, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>His own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden in the cords of his ſins.</hi> But he may repent when he cometh to die, and then all his ſins will be forgiven. <hi>I tell you,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, it will be otherwiſe. So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, v. 23. <hi>He ſhall die without inſtruction, and in the greatneſs of his folly he ſhall go aſtray, q. d.</hi> The promiſe of his future repentance, his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed repentance, will come to nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved hardneth his neck,

And ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken</hi> [If he ſhall incourage himſelf in ſin, and delay his repentance, upon hopes that he hath time enough to make his peace with God hereafter.] <hi>The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not ware of. And ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>

               <p>So much for the <hi>fourth general head,</hi> wherein we muſt be cautious that we follow not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the multitude; <hi>namely</hi> the timeing of religion, when it is proſecuted.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt principle of the multitude,</hi> concerns the nature of God, and it is this. <hi>That God is not ſo ſevere and exact in the obſerving mens wayes and actions, as ſome preciſe miniſters would bear them in hand he is.</hi> Surely <hi>think they,</hi> the Lord doth not make any ſuch great matter, <hi>whether we be holy or not;</hi> he doth not ſo much ſtand upon <hi>ſtrictneſs,</hi> and <hi>circumſpection</hi> in our carriage; nor will he be ſo rigorous as to require it of us.

Thus they reaſon themſelves into wickedneſs, and the <hi>wicked one</hi> ſtrikes in to promote theſe <hi>reaſonings,</hi> Pſal. 10.11. <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart, God hath for gotten it: he hideth his face, he will never ſee it.</hi> Again v. 13. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn

For they ſay, the Lord ſeeth us not, the Lord hath forſaken the earth.</hi> Mark it, they went on in ſin, and idolatry, being acted by the <hi>influence</hi> of this curſed <hi>principle.</hi> Now therefore, this <hi>principle</hi> muſt be demoliſhed, and thrown down: For men will never venture through the oppoſitions and reproaches of the <hi>multitude,</hi> that they may be accepted of God, unleſs they be fully convinced, that God mindeth their wayes, and that holineſs is pleaſing in his ſight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thus perfect,</hi> Job. 31.4. <hi>Doth not he ſee my wayes, and count all my ſteps?</hi> Prov. 5.20, 21. <hi>Why wilt thou, my Son, he raviſhed with a ſtrang wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and embrace the boſom of a ſtranger?

Jo. 8.9. Let me therefore ask thee <hi>this one queſtion. Doth not thy conſcience ſometimes ſmite thee,</hi> for thy profaneſs and hypocriſy?

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106335:109"/>Why, <hi>O vain man,</hi> doth <hi>conſcience</hi> obſerve which God hath planted in thy breaſt? and doth not <hi>God</hi> obſerve more <hi>exactly,</hi> by whom it was planted? <hi>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</hi> 1 Jo. 3.20. <hi>Underſtand, O ye brutiſh among the people, and ye fools when will ye be wiſe? He that planted the ear, ſhall not he hear? He that formed the eye</hi> [this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, reflective eye of the ſoul] <hi>ſhall not he ſee? He that chaſtizeth the heathen, ſhall not he correct? He that teacheth man knowledg, ſhall not he know? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity,</hi> Pſal. 94.8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Settle this <hi>principle</hi> alſo in the place of the other, <hi>that all the diſpenſations of God towards the children of men, have a direct and natural tendency to lead them to repentance, and to quicken them to walk in wayes of holineſs. To this end</hi> he gave his <hi>word</hi> to inſtruct them, and <hi>his ſpirit</hi> to ſtrive with them, and hath appointed <hi>his ordinances</hi> to be attended upon by them. <hi>Upon this account</hi> he doth <hi>wait</hi> in the exerciſe of <hi>his long ſuffering</hi> towards ſome, and ſends <hi>his miniſters</hi> to treat with them in his name. <hi>To this end,</hi> he executeth <hi>ſore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon others, and maketh them to taſt the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of ſin in the <hi>fruits</hi> of it. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of all <hi>exhortations</hi> and <hi>counſels,</hi> of all <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>promiſes</hi> on the other hand; of all <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>providences</hi> of every ſort. And can you be ſo <hi>ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi> as to imagine that the <hi>infinitely wiſe God</hi> would be at ſuch <hi>coſt</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> to drive men out of their ſins and to draw them to godlineſs, <hi>and yet not regard whether they are holy or not?</hi> You will
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106335:110"/>not impute ſuch <hi>folly</hi> to a <hi>conſiderate, ſober man;</hi> that he would be at a vaſt <hi>expence</hi> in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh a deſign, and then not care whether it be <hi>accompliſhed or no?</hi> And dareſt thou to charg this <hi>folly</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> whoſe <hi>wiſdom</hi> is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and of whoſe <hi>underſtanding</hi> there is no ſearching out? Conſider, <hi>O man,</hi> what <hi>expence</hi> the Lord hath been at upon <hi>thy ſoul. Sometimes</hi> he hath watered thee with his <hi>bleſſings</hi> from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>again</hi> exerciſed thee under ſharp <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Now</hi> he hath indulged thee the uſe of <hi>ſpiritual opportunities,</hi> and dealt with thee by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward convictions,</hi> and anon deprived thee of theſe <hi>excellent advantages</hi> that you might learn their <hi>worth</hi> by the <hi>want</hi> of them, if by any means you might be prevailed with to forſake the evil of your wayes. And doth not he care, <hi>for all this,</hi> whether you forſake them or not? <hi>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> [what coſt or pains could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, that hath not been ſpent upon you?] <hi>Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> Iſa. 5.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The account and reckoning unto which ſinners muſt be called, at the tribunal ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt, will be a very ſtrict and exact reckoning, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with them will be ſevere proceedings.</hi> For <hi>God will bring every work into judgment, and every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</hi> Eccl. 12.14. <hi>He will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the counſels of the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. And if his eyes were not upon all the wayes of man, how could he bring them to ſuch a <hi>preciſe account? How could God</hi> thus
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106335:110"/>
                  <hi>judg the world?</hi> He will ſentence the wicked unto eternal burnings, unto intolerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſhall never have an end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil, and his angels.</hi> And can it be imagined that he will do thus, for a matter that he doth not regard?

God forbid.</hi> Let not ſuch a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thought be harboured within your ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Though the ungodly may be ſuffered to proſper for a while in reference to the things of this life, yet there are ſore ſpiritual judgments inflicted on them here, and they are reſerved alſo to the day of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> This is a <hi>principle</hi> needful to be riveted in mens ſpirits, in oppoſition to that of the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:</hi> For it is the want of a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>this,</hi> which is the ground whereupon they embrace <hi>that.</hi> Why do ſinners think, that God regardeth it not, whether they be ſtrict or looſe? whether they walk after the ſpirit, or according to the luſts of the fleſh? <hi>Becauſe they ſee the ungodly proſper in the world,</hi> and there is no difference put, in the providences of God, between the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>wicked:</hi> all things come alike unto all, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ye ſay, every one that doth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord, or where is the God of judgment, q. d.</hi> If God be ſo much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſin, <hi>why doth he not puniſh the ſinners?</hi> If he love the wayes of holineſs, <hi>why doth he not deal favourably, and kindly, with them that are holy?</hi> If any are <hi>fat,</hi> and in a <hi>flouriſhing condition,</hi> it is for the moſt part the workers of iniquity: and if any

Well, <hi>but mind it Sirs,</hi> As the Lord hath <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings,</hi> the choiceſt favours, <hi>hidden manna,</hi> which the world ſeeth not, to beſtow upon his <hi>children:</hi> So he hath <hi>ſpiritual plagues,</hi> the ſoreſt effects of his indignation <hi>in this life,</hi> which are poured

And the time of <hi>remarkeable difference,</hi> betwixt <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> is reſerved till the end of this world, when <hi>the wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God:</hi> and then ſhall <hi>the righteous ſhine as the ſtars for ever in the kingdom of their Father,</hi> Job. 21.7, 8, 9, 29, 30. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old, yea are mighty in power? Their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight, and their off-ſpring before their eyes. Their houſes are ſafe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</hi> Mark the <hi>anſwer</hi> to this <hi>quaery,</hi> v. 29.30. <hi>Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do not ye know their tokens? That the wicked is reſerved to the day of deſtruction, they ſhall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the <hi>firſt great principle</hi> of the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> which concerns the nature of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond principle of the multitude,</hi> whereby they force themſelves into ſin, <hi>relates to</hi> the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of godlineſs, <hi>viz.

Thus <hi>Jehu</hi> gloried in the goodneſs of his <hi>heart,</hi> though he only carried on his own <hi>ſecular intereſt,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from the ſins of <hi>Jereboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> 2 Kings 10.15. <hi>Is thine heart right, as mine heart is with thy heart?</hi> And thus <hi>Saul</hi> pleaded that he meant well, however he kept not the commandment of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.11, 12. <hi>My brethren,</hi> if you will ſtand faſt againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the multitude, you muſt get rid of this <hi>rotten principle:</hi> and know, that if there be <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs in the heart,</hi> there will be a proportionable degree and meaſure of the <hi>power of godlineſs</hi> expreſſed in the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>converſation.</hi> According to grace <hi>within,</hi> ſo will be the tenour of your carriage <hi>without,</hi> 1 Jo. 3.7. <hi>Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, let no man deceive you; he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous.</hi> Again <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106335:112"/>is not of God,</hi> to keep you, from under the <hi>ſway,</hi> and <hi>power, of this principle</hi> of the <hi>multitude,</hi> get theſe <hi>three contrary principles,</hi> rivited in your hearts, in the room of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the heart of a man, as it is the ſeat of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſpiritual qualifications, ſo it is the well-ſpring of action.</hi> All external practiſes are but ſtreams, that flow from that <hi>fountain;</hi> but <hi>fruit,</hi> that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon that <hi>tree.</hi> So that if your <hi>converſations</hi> be vile and abominable, it is impoſſible but your <hi>hearts</hi> ſhould be filled with wickedneſs, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations alſo. If the <hi>words</hi> be light and frothy, the <hi>heart</hi> cannot be ſerious: Becauſe <hi>the mouth ſpeaketh out of the abundance of the heart.</hi> If the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> be wanton and effeminate, the <hi>heart</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be chaſt, for all that wantoneſs proceedeth out of the heart, <hi>and ſo I might inſtance in other caſes,</hi> Mar. 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>For from within out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries; fornications, murders, thefts, covetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laſciviouſneſs, an evil eye, blaſphemy, pride, fooliſhneſs: All theſe evil things come from within, and defile the man.</hi> Mark it, if there be any ſin and wickedneſs allowed in the life, <hi>it will of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow,</hi> that the heart is corrupt and naught: That is the <hi>ſource</hi> and <hi>original</hi> from whence ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actions are derived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The new creature, which is formed in the hearts and ſpirits of all the children of God, whereby alone they are made good and upright, is in its own nature and tendency, an active principle.</hi> It will raiſe a man from <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>heaven,</hi> and keep him from ſin and impiety, <hi>that he may be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> Grace within is <hi>as the ointment of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106335:112"/>right hand,</hi> that will diſcover it ſelf. So that if you live in the practiſe of any <hi>known ſin,</hi> or in the neglect of any <hi>known duty, glory not, and lie not againſt the truth</hi> (as S. <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it, cap. 3.14.) <hi>i. e.</hi> Do not boaſt of the goodneſs of your hearts; <hi>for it is a lie:</hi> They cannot be good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs your lives be filled with all <hi>goodneſs.</hi> If your hearts are right with the Lord, your wayes will be repleniſhed <hi>with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto his praiſe and glory. A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treaſure, bringeth forth evil things,</hi> Mat. 12.35. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him. And he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 Jo. 3.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The rule which Chriſt will obſerve,</hi> in his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proceedings, <hi>according to which he will pronounce the ſentence of</hi> abſolution <hi>or</hi> condemnation, <hi>and ſend the ſons of men to their eternal eſtate, will be according to their workes.</hi> He will judg of your hearts, by the tenour of your <hi>converſations:</hi> And then the fooliſhneſs of this pretence will appear. <hi>that a mans heart may be good when his wayes are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt:</hi> For Chriſt will give to every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wayes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great, ſtand before God: and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books, according to their works.</hi> Again v. 13. <hi>And they were judged every man, according to their works.</hi> So that, <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106335:113"/>the fleſh ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8.</p>
               <p>That's the <hi>ſecond principle</hi> of the <hi>multitude,</hi> of which you muſt beware.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third principle</hi> of the <hi>multitude,</hi> which you muſt carefully avoid, that you may not be led by their <hi>example</hi> into the commiſſion of ſin, hath reſpect <hi>to the benefit ariſing from the ſervice of God.</hi> The <hi>principle</hi> is this, <hi>That the following of the world brings viſible profit, and advantage along with it: but there is no benefit or emolument that doth come byſt rictneſs in the wayes of religion.</hi> The fear of the Lord ſeems a <hi>fruitleſs way,</hi> in their eyes. They cannot but confeſs, that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, <hi>to be much in ſeeking after him, to pray without ceaſing,</hi> to be <hi>ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abounding in the work of the Lord:</hi> But <hi>what good is there to be got by ſo doing? Where is the income of religion, that it bringeth along with it? What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage do men get by ſetting apart ſo many dayes of faſting, and prayer,</hi> and the like ſpiritual exerciſes? <hi>Job.</hi> 21.14, 15. <hi>Therefore they ſay unto God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, <hi>for we deſire not the knowledg of thy wayes. What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhall we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> And you find <hi>this principle</hi> in the hearts of thoſe ſtubborn, and refractory ſinners, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Ye have ſaid, it is vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hoſts? q. d.</hi> Men grow <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>wealthy</hi> by compliance with ſin, but there's nothing to be gotten, <hi>at all,</hi> by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106335:113"/>walking humbly with God, and attendance upon his ſervice. This falſe <hi>principle</hi> Sirs, muſt be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> and <hi>diſowned,</hi> if you will keep your ſelves free from the taint of <hi>worldly pollutions:</hi> For by walking contrary to the <hi>multitude,</hi> by the ſtraight line of <hi>pure religion,</hi> you may poſſibly be ſurrounded with many <hi>dangers,</hi> and ſuffer much <hi>loſs;</hi> and that you will never willingly do, unleſs you ſee ſomething in godlineſs, able to <hi>countervail</hi> thoſe dangers, and to make <hi>repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of your loſſes. Except you apprehend <hi>a good conſcience</hi> to be a matter of conſiderable <hi>worth,</hi> and <hi>value,</hi> you will never be at any great <hi>coſt</hi> and <hi>expence</hi> in order to keep a <hi>good conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the excluding therefore of theſe corrupt apprehenſions, indeavour to faſten <hi>three contrary principles,</hi> upon your ſpirits <hi>in their ſtead;</hi> which I ſhall but juſt touch upon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That walking cloſely with God, in the high way of holineſs is a ſure means to evidence that God hath made with you an everlaſting covenant, and to keep you under the verg of his peculiar favour, and regard.</hi> And is it no profit, to have the <hi>Lord of hoſts</hi> to be your faſt <hi>friend,</hi> and <hi>portion</hi> for ever? Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be made a ſpecial <hi>favourite,</hi> unto the King of heaven? <hi>Why man,</hi> the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof: The heart of all men, <hi>even the Kings heart is in the hands of the Lord, and as the rivers of water, he turneth it whether he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> All the <hi>Armies</hi> of heaven, and the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> of the world, are at his <hi>beck,</hi> and under his <hi>guidance.</hi> And, is it nothing to be under the ſpecial care and protection of this <hi>Generaliſſimo?</hi> this ſovereign commander? Is it a matter little to be regarded, to enjoy the <hi>ſmiles</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:106335:114"/>of his reconciled countenance? <hi>Are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God, become ſmall in your eyes?</hi> Surely <hi>David</hi> put another kind of <hi>eſtimate</hi> upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>There be many that ſay who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon us,</hi> Pſal. 34.2. <hi>My ſoul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord.</hi> I have ſometimes read of one of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that when the <hi>Spanyard</hi> ſent to denounce war againſt him, and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld</hi> proclaimed all his maſters titles, as King of <hi>Caſtile, Arragon, Sicelie, Naples,</hi> and the reſt; The <hi>French King</hi> returned to every one of them diſtinctly, <hi>I am King, of France, I am King of France:</hi> thereby <hi>intimating,</hi> that by that one flouriſhing Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> he was able to <hi>out boaſt</hi> the other in the <hi>multitude</hi> of his <hi>dominions.</hi> So may a believer by the enjoyment of one God, be able to <hi>outboaſt</hi> the worldling in all that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth. Hath he abundance of riches? But I, <hi>may a ſincere Chriſtian ſay,</hi> have the <hi>eternal God for my portion,</hi> who is the giver of all things, from whom every good and perfect gift doth proceed. Hath the worldling the favour of great men, of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Emperours? But I have the friendſhip of God, who is the ſupreme King; and all Princes and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates upon earth are but his vaſſals and ſubjects.</hi> Is he advanced to honour and great dignity? Well, <hi>but I am a ſon or daughter of the living God,</hi> which is far higher <hi>preferment</hi> than the mightieſt men can confer on their <hi>favourites.</hi> All that the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling poſſeſſeth, is but for a ſmall pittance of time; <hi>but a believer hath intereſt in eternal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in a crown and kingdome that cannot be ſhaken.</hi> And is the way to this kingdome an <hi>unprofitable</hi> way? Mind what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106335:114"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10, 11. <hi>For a day in thy Courts is better then a thouſand. I would chuſe rather to ſit at the threſhold, in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs. For the Lord God is a Sun, and a ſhield; The Lord will give grace, and glory: No good thing will he withold, from them that walk uprightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The profit and advantage of godlineſs, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſpiritual profit, whereas the hearts of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are earthly, ſenſual, and carnal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that they are not able to diſcern the ſweetneſs and excellency of religion.</hi> Not as if there were no ſuch thing to be <hi>perceived,</hi> but their ſpirits are <hi>indiſpoſed,</hi> and altogether <hi>uncapable</hi> of the <hi>right perception</hi> thereof. For to a through diſcerning of any excellency whatſoever, there muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a <hi>proportion</hi> betwixt the excellency <hi>diſcerned,</hi> and the power <hi>or faculty by which it is diſcerned.</hi> To make it clear by a familiar illuſtration. If I diſcourſe with an <hi>Husbandman,</hi> of ſome profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of <hi>manuring of land,</hi> or concerning the beſt method of <hi>ordering grain</hi> and <hi>tillage;</hi> he will eaſily diſcern the <hi>import</hi> of ſuch diſcourſe, and the benefit of ſuch <hi>experiments,</hi> as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him in that behalf. But if you ſhould read to him the moſt admirable <hi>lecture,</hi> in <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Opticks, Metaphyſicks,</hi> or the like: He will not apprehend the uſefulneſs of it. <hi>Why?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> in his underſtanding, for the reception of the <hi>one,</hi> and not of the other. <hi>Thus it is in this caſe:</hi> If a man would diſcern <hi>ſpiritual excellencies,</hi> he muſt have a <hi>ſpiritual eye. If he would taſt ſweetneſs in the ſervice of God, he muſt have a ſpiritual palate.</hi> But now the unregenerate
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106335:115"/>are <hi>carnal,</hi> and <hi>earthly:</hi> Their ſpirits lye grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the earth, and their minds are linked and faſtened to things below, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God: for they are fooliſhneſs to him. Neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> If a <hi>blind man</hi> do not perceive the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of the <hi>Sun;</hi> It is not from any defect in that <hi>glorious body:</hi> but through the defect of his <hi>ſight. So</hi> if the wicked do not ſee the profit of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is not through any <hi>defect</hi> in <hi>religion;</hi> But becauſe themſelves are <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>cannot ſee afar off,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The great reaſon, why perſons go empty away from the ſervice of God, and ſo bring up an evil report upon godlineſs,</hi> as if it were an unprofitable work, <hi>is becauſe their hearts are not upright in the ſight of the Lord, but they deal falſly in his covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do their work <hi>by halfes,</hi> and in a ſlight and ſuperficial way; and ſo fall ſhort of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in the performance of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our Souls, and thou takeſt no knowledg?</hi> Mark the anſwer that is returned to theſe groundleſs complaints. <hi>Behold in the day of your faſt you find pleaſure, and exact all your labours. Behold, you faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs. Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen? q. d.</hi> If you did not play the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> in the obedience you tender; you ſhould never have cauſe to complain of my unreadineſs to reward you. If you were faithful in the <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of my ſtatutes, I would <hi>in no caſe</hi> fail the expectation of your ſouls. <hi>But ye brought that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106335:115"/>which was torn, and the lame, and the ſick: Thus you brought an offering: Should I accept of this at your hand, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Mal. 1.13. <hi>My brethren,</hi> the emolument and advantage of religion, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon the <hi>power of godlineſs:</hi> No wonder, that they find it not, who have only the <hi>form.</hi> For <hi>bodily exerciſe profiteth little: But godlineſs</hi> [reall and ſubſtantial godlineſs] <hi>is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. And therefore the Lord appeals to the very <hi>conſciences</hi> of his people, whether ever they could ſay, that they had ſought him in vain, when they did ſeek him in ſincerity, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. <hi>O thou that art named,</hi> the houſe of Jacob, <hi>Is the ſpirit of the Lord ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Are theſe his doings? Do not my words do good, to him that walketh uprightly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is the <hi>third principle of the multitude,</hi> to be rooted up, out of your ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth Principle of the multitude</hi> which you muſt utterly reject, if you will not be led aſide by their <hi>errour</hi> into ſin, <hi>hath reference</hi> to the way of ſalvation, and the means of coming to the kingdom of heaven. <hi>That a perſon need not take ſo much pains, nor make ſo much adoe, in order to the attainment of eternal life, as commonly Miniſters preſs men unto: But a man may be ſaved well enough, without preciſeneſs and circumſpection over his wayes.</hi> They cannot but acknowledg, but that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the ſcriptures exhorteth men to <hi>be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,</hi> and watchful, <hi>in every thing to be circumſpect,</hi> and <hi>not to come neer to an evil matter: To contend earneſtly for the faith, and to ſtrive to enter in at the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106335:116"/>ſtrait gate.</hi> And indeed, <hi>will they ſay,</hi> theſe things are not amiſs in <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that have nothing elſe to mind, but to inveigh againſt ſin, and to ſtudy the word of the Lord: But they cannot believe, <hi>they are of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation;</hi> but that a man may do well enough, though he, <hi>now and then,</hi> indulge himſelf to ſatisfie his luſts. They will <hi>never be perſwaded,</hi> that God will damn all that come not up to theſe <hi>rigid terms.</hi> Thus they harden their hearts againſt the fear of the Lord, and ſet open a door unto <hi>licentiouſneſs.</hi> Deut. 29.19. <hi>I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to adde drunkeneſs to thirſt.</hi> As if the ſinner ſhould have ſaid, <hi>as carnal people in our dayes are wont to doe.</hi> Do you think, <hi>Heaven</hi> was appointed only for a <hi>company</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> that make more <hi>Scruples</hi> than they need? Why may not a man take his fill of pleaſures <hi>upon earth,</hi> and yet come to the kingdom of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> as well as others? ſurely God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to tye us up in ſuch narrow bounds as theſe <hi>Strait-lac't Preachers</hi> would perſwade us. <hi>Come, let us fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and take our freedom whilſt we may, and yet our ſouls ſhall do as well as theirs.</hi> If you would ſee the farther work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this <hi>curſed</hi> and <hi>Helliſh principle,</hi> conſult, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.14, 15. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My beloved,</hi> if you will keep your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the world, great care muſt be taken that you give not the leaſt <hi>reception</hi> or <hi>entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> unto theſe <hi>deviliſh dictates.</hi> For if once ſuch <hi>libertine thoughts</hi> do but enter into your <hi>heads,</hi> they will quickly fall down, as a mighty <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> upon your <hi>hearts,</hi> and carry you headlong
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106335:116"/>to all exceſs of riot. As the <hi>firſt</hi> point of wiſdom is, <hi>to pitch upon the right end:</hi> So the <hi>next</hi> is, <hi>to take care of electing and cloſing with the ſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means,</hi> for compaſſing that end. If you fancy to your ſelves, <hi>an eaſy way to ſalvation,</hi> you do thereby <hi>tempt the tempter,</hi> to lead you in the <hi>broad way</hi> to deſtruction. Your ſpirits are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>as a City without gates or walls,</hi> open to all the inroades of that <hi>wicked one,</hi> and of wicked men that are his inſtruments. And therefore to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> your ſouls againſt this <hi>Poyſonous principle,</hi> let theſe <hi>three contrary principles</hi> ſink deep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt is expreſſe concerning it, that the way of ſalvation is a narrow, and difficult way: and that there are but few of thoſe, that ſit under the teachings of the word of God, that will arrive with ſafety at the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Mark it, <hi>I ſay,</hi> theſe are truths which are frequently <hi>inculcated</hi> and very clearly <hi>aſſerted.</hi> They are not <hi>dark no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>concluſions,</hi> that are pretended to be drawn <hi>by far-fetcht conſequences,</hi> from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but they are delivered ſo <hi>plainly,</hi> that there is no way left for evading the force of them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtraitgate: for wide is the gate and broad is the way, that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deſtruction, and many there be which go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. Becauſe ſtrait is the gate</hi> [or how ſtrait is the gate?] <hi>amd narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Not only the way of holineſs, in the utmoſt extent of it, is a difficult way; but the way that leadeth unto life; ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as is of <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> to conduct a ſinner to ſalvation; And they are but an handful in

But this may be meant, <hi>will the carnal profeſſour ſay,</hi> in relation to <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and groſs <hi>Idolaters,</hi> that worſhip a falſe God, and never had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> We are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>members of the Church,</hi> and <hi>hear the word of the Lord.</hi> Se therefore what our Saviour ſaith in another place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14. <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> When are ſinners <hi>externally called,</hi> by a common vocation, but when the <hi>word of God</hi> ſounds in their <hi>eares,</hi> inviting them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> deals by his motions with their <hi>hearts,</hi> admoniſhing and perſwading them to come unto Chriſt, that they may be ſaved? And few <hi>of this ſort</hi> attain to eternal life. Look into the <hi>old world,</hi> and there were but <hi>eight perſons</hi> ſaved from the deluge, whereof there was one, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> an hypocrite; and the reſt of the world were ſwept away, not only with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of <hi>temporal deſtruction,</hi> but into the pit of <hi>eternal perdition.</hi> Conſider the ſtate of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and there could not be found <hi>ten righteous perſons</hi> in that populous City. But leaſt you ſhould ſay that theſe were profeſſed <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and ſo the caſe not <hi>parallel,</hi> with ſuch as are <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> the people of God: Let us therefore make inſpection into the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Elias</hi> made interceſſion to the Lord againſt them, who thought that <hi>only himſelf</hi> had been left alone faithful unto <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And pray, what was the anſwer of God unto him? See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I have reſerved to my ſelf, ſeven thouſand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</hi> Mark it, <hi>but ſeven thouſand</hi> in the whole kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:106335:117"/>that conſiſted of <hi>ten of the Tribes.</hi> We read of <hi>eleven hundred and threeſcore thouſand mighty men of valour,</hi> at one time, in the <hi>two tribes</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> beſides the <hi>ſouldiers</hi> that kept the <hi>gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> Now if you ſhould reckon <hi>proportionably,</hi> concerning the <hi>ten tribes,</hi> and make but a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable computation of the reſt of the people, men and women, <hi>What were ſeven thouſand in reſpect of the whole? What an inconſiderable pittance?</hi> ſcarcely, <hi>one of a thouſand.</hi> However <hi>the caſe is plain,</hi> there are but few in compariſon that hear the word of the Lord, that will come to the ſtate of bleſſedneſs in the enjoyment of the Lord. And, <hi>to bring this matter to an head,</hi> if the way to <hi>Heaven</hi> were eaſy, how comes it to paſs that <hi>ſuch multitudes periſh?</hi> If men might be ſaved at a <hi>cheap rate,</hi> without <hi>ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> whence is it that the <hi>greateſt number</hi> fall ſhort of ſalvation? If the <hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi> are in the way to <hi>heaven,</hi> who are the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> in the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> that Chriſt tells us, ſhall be ſent into the <hi>chains of darkneſs?</hi> Do not you tremble, when you meet with ſuch paſſages in the <hi>Bible?</hi> I am afraid, <hi>Sirs,</hi> you dare not ſeriouſly <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>meditate</hi> upon ſuch ſcripture-truths, leaſt they ſhould make your hearts to <hi>ake,</hi> and <hi>awaken</hi> you out of your <hi>golden dreams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though there are <hi>degrees of grace,</hi> and <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaſures</hi> of holineſs in the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>ſervants of God:</hi> and many perſons that are ſaved never attained to that <hi>ſtature</hi> and <hi>pitch</hi> of godlineſs <hi>in this life,</hi> at which ſome have arrived: <hi>Yet there are ſuch things of abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity to ſalvation, and to evidence that you are partakers of ſaving grace</hi> in the ſmalleſt degree, <hi>that will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106335:118"/>manifeſt that Heaven is not to be got without much pains and diligence in the purſuance of it,</hi> Mat. 11.12. <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> There is no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that City, <hi>except you ſtorm it:</hi> unleſs you <hi>vehemently ſtrive</hi> to lay hold upon it. Lazy <hi>wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>wouldings</hi> will never bring you thither. <hi>Lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>ſlothfulneſs</hi> will certainly fall ſhort of it. The bare <hi>external</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome duties whilſt in other things you take liberty to indulg the fleſh, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly leave you ſtill in the ſtate of <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> what ever fond conceits you may have of the contrary.</p>
               <p>Let us lightly paſs over the mention of ſome particulars that are of abſolute neceſſity to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. (1) <hi>The whole nature muſt be cleanſed from the power of ſin,</hi> and every corruption <hi>mortified</hi> and brought into ſubjection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. (2) <hi>The whole perſon muſt be devoted and conſecrated unto the Lord;</hi> and ſurrendred into his hands, to be at Gods diſpoſal, and to follow him, <hi>at his feet,</hi> without <hi>reſervation</hi> and <hi>exception</hi> of any part or faculty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. (3) <hi>All the time of a mans life muſt be dedicated to the ſervice of the moſt high;</hi> and to the imployment of holineſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. (4) <hi>Every known ſin muſt be actually abandoned and forſaken</hi> they muſt be utterly abandoned and caſt off, never to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any more, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.19, 21. (5) <hi>All the commandments of the Lord muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,</hi> and a conſcientious regard muſt be had unto the due performance of every known duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. (6) <hi>The whole flock of our outward
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106335:118"/>enjoyments muſt be managed in a ſubordination to the glory of God, and eternal concernments:</hi> and be readily <hi>abandoned</hi> and <hi>rejected,</hi> even the deareſt of them, when they come in <hi>competition</hi> with cloſe walking with God: and the <hi>foreſt tortures</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> willingly ſubmitted to, rather than be driven back into the wayes of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24, 25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Now let us caſt <hi>our eyes back</hi> on theſe things, and ſee whether they can be done <hi>with a wet finger.</hi> The reaſon, why carnal people imagine, that they may come to heaven, without much circumſpection and ſtrictneſs, is, becauſe they know not what <hi>reall holineſs is,</hi> nor wherein it doth conſiſt, which is the only way that leadeth to heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let <hi>this principle</hi> alſo be erected and ſet up in your ſouls, <hi>that although no Chriſtian doth attain to an abſolute perfection of grace or holineſs in this life; yet the meaneſt ſincere Chriſtian, every true believer, is ſtill preſſing after perfection.</hi> He doth not allow himſelf in the leaſt iniquity, but is ſtill cleanſing himſelf <hi>further</hi> every day, and <hi>preſſing forward</hi> in godlineſs, till he hath gotten to the <hi>Mark.</hi> He doth not content himſelf with any attainments <hi>received;</hi> but is ever labouring after more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance with God, and a cloſer fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. Every <hi>ſound Chriſtian</hi> takes the life of Chriſt, for his <hi>pattern.</hi> And though ſometimes it falleth out that he maketh <hi>blots</hi> and <hi>blurres</hi> in tranſcribing, yet he ſtudieth to write as neer as may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>copy,</hi> 1 Jo. 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:106335:119"/>
               <p>So much for the raiſing of that <hi>fourth</hi> curſed and corrupt <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The next <hi>Principle of the multitude,</hi> is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accomodations of <hi>this life,</hi> the good things of this world. <hi>That it is a point of the greateſt wiſdom, to make ſure of all that can be gotten here, and let us truſt God with our ſouls, for they cannot be left in better hands.</hi> They think <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver</hi> are <hi>ſure friends,</hi> upon all occaſions; and make way for a man in any buſineſs whatſoever: And therefore they count ſuch men <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>idiots,</hi> that know not their own <hi>concerns,</hi> who will part with theſe things upon the <hi>niceties of conſcience;</hi> and will loſe their <hi>worldly advantages,</hi> upon any ground whatſoever. For themſelves, <hi>they had rather truſt God with their ſouls, than men with their bodies and eſtates.</hi> So that whatever cometh of it, they will be ſure to get, what they can, that they may have ſomewhat to rely upon, in the time of need, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City, and an high wall in his own conceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the prevention of the workings of this <hi>ſoul-deſtructive principle,</hi> let theſe enſuing <hi>leſſons</hi> be well imprinted on your ſpirits, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently weighed and pondered in your thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The God of holineſs hath threatned to blaſt the indeavours, and bring the labours to nought, of ſuch as eagerly and obſtinately purſue the things of this life, and neglect to be diligent in laying up a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for eternity.</hi> When they are earneſtly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on getting <hi>riches,</hi> and care not to keep <hi>undefiled conſciences,</hi> the Lord is wont to ſend a <hi>curſe</hi> upon their <hi>bleſſings,</hi> and to <hi>ſhrivel</hi> their <hi>gains</hi> into a very
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106335:119"/>
                  <hi>narrow</hi> compaſs. So that, what profit hath a man, <hi>in ſuch a caſe,</hi> of all his pains and labour, whereby his heart hath been diſquieted? <hi>Why Sirs, it is the bleſſing of God that maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10.22. And what if that bleſſing be withholden from you? Then all your enjoyments will <hi>wither</hi> and <hi>crumble into duſt,</hi> even as <hi>flowers</hi> fade at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>Sun.</hi> And this is none other, than you may well expect, if you follow <hi>this world</hi> to the neglect of <hi>the other world.</hi> This he is wont to execute, upon the children of men, when they wound their <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>conſciences,</hi> to get the <hi>traſh</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> of the <hi>earth:</hi> when they follow after <hi>this world</hi> and take no heed <hi>to walk in the ſteps of his precepts.</hi> Sometimes God <hi>bloweth</hi> upon their labour, and travel, that they weary themſelves as in thefire for very vanity, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why, ſaith the Lord of hoſts? Becauſe of mine houſe that is waſte and ye run every man to his own houſe.</hi> Sometimes he ſuffers them <hi>to have much,</hi> but doth not give them <hi>an heart to enjoy</hi> what they have: They have no <hi>profit,</hi> nor can ſuck any <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> or <hi>comfort,</hi> out of their greateſt abundance, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.1, 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he leaveth them to the <hi>ſwing of their luſts,</hi> to ſpend what they got for their <hi>bodies,</hi> to the ruine and deſtruction of their <hi>ſouls:</hi> So that all they have is too little, to ſatisfie thoſe, <hi>unſatiable,</hi> and <hi>untamed,</hi> luſts. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is but yet a little while, and all the good things of this world ſhall not, in the leaſt be able to do you good.</hi> They cannot ſupport under the <hi>terrours</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>in this life;</hi> much leſs can they prevent
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106335:120"/>the <hi>ſtroke</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> or allay the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of that paſſage. They may adde to the <hi>tortures</hi> of <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> becauſe of their evil getting, and miſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; but cannot miniſter a dram of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> to the departing ſpirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.2. They may increaſe the puniſhment aſſigned, in the day of <hi>judgment:</hi> but no way prevail to the <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or <hi>revocation,</hi> of the ſentence of the <hi>Judg.</hi> he will not regard thy riches, nor thouſands of gold and ſilver. <hi>When a rich man dieth, he ſhall carry nothing away: His glory ſhall not deſcend after him. Though whiles he lived, he bleſſed his Soul; and men will praiſe thee, when thou doſt well to thy ſelf: He ſhall go to the generation of his fathers; they ſhall never ſee light,</hi> Pſal. 49.17, 18, 19. <hi>Now</hi> it is accounted a piece of the chiefeſt wiſdom, to get much in this world, <hi>however it be gotten.</hi> But <hi>in the end,</hi> the worldling <hi>ſhall be a fool,</hi> Jer. 17.11. <hi>i. e.</hi> Then it will appear what an <hi>egregious Dolt</hi> he was; his folly will be declared before men and Angels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whereas the Earthworm pretends, that he will truſt God with his Soul,</hi> know, <hi>that the Lord will have nothing to do, in a way of mercy, with ſuch: but will leave them to fall and periſh by their own counſels.</hi> But will not God preſerve thoſe <hi>that truſt in him? Yea,</hi> but this is not to truſt in the Lord, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely to tempt him: <hi>And he will repay ſuch as hate him to their face.</hi> Then do we place our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> under his ſhadow, when our dependance is acted <hi>in the way of righteouſneſſe:</hi> When we give up our ſelves, in integrity, to be his ſervants, and keep the way of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3, 7, 34. If perſons live in ſin, and mind
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106335:120"/>earthly things, and yet ſay <hi>they lean upon the Lord:</hi> This very preſumption will bring upon them a <hi>ſore,</hi> and <hi>inevitable,</hi> deſtruction, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11, 12.</p>
               <p>So much, to eradicate and pluck up that <hi>fifth Principle</hi> out of your hearts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>ſixth helliſh principle</hi> eſpouſed, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, by the <hi>multitude</hi> concerns the evil of thoſe ſins, in which they live, and with the filth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are wont to defile themſelves. Their <hi>Tenent</hi> is this, <hi>that there is no great hurt in their irregularities and tranſgreſſions: nor are they ſuch miſchievous things, as many are preſſed to believe.</hi> What harm is there <hi>(will they ſay)</hi> if a man talk <hi>idly</hi> and <hi>frothily?</hi> If they now and then <hi>revel,</hi> and <hi>tipple,</hi> in a way of <hi>merriment,</hi> and to paſs away their time? <hi>They hope,</hi> no body is the worſe for it; they know indeed, they are actions <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> in the word, but <hi>what hurt is there in them,</hi> if they tend to no mans loſs, or detriment? They pray God, <hi>they may never do worſe, and the like.</hi> They cannot deny, but they are forbidden <hi>to adde to the word of the Lord; To introduce mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions into his worſhip; To ſet their Poſts by his Poſts, and their threſholds by his threſhold.</hi> But what need men keep ſuch <hi>a doe</hi> againſt them, being <hi>innocent harmleſſe</hi> things; eſpecially if they are appointed for <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>edification?</hi> However they are confident, that if they do <hi>no good,</hi> yet there is no great matter of hurt in them. <hi>This I might inſtance in many caſes:</hi> For it is the <hi>ordinary plea,</hi> which ſinners produce, to juſtifie much of their impiety, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Is this of thy whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms a ſmall matter, q. d.</hi> Surely it appears a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106335:121"/>ſmall matter in your eyes. Theſe are <hi>ſinful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions</hi> which are ſedulouſly to be <hi>mortified,</hi> and ſubdued: For unleſs your minds are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <hi>with abhorring thoughts of ſin,</hi> your ſouls can never be throughly humbled for it; nor will be at much pains or <hi>expence</hi> to eſcape the pollution. But I have ſpoken abundantly to this, in one or two places before. Only let me beſeech you to put theſe <hi>two interrogatories,</hi> home upon your conſciences.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>Is there no hurt, in provoking the Lord of glory to indignation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not he the <hi>life</hi> of thy life, and the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of thy heart, and the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>giver</hi> of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which thou enjoyeſt? Cannot he ſtrip thee <hi>naked,</hi> and leave thee <hi>deſolate,</hi> in a moment? Is not he able to fill thy bones with <hi>ſorrowes,</hi> and thy Spirit with <hi>anguiſh,</hi> and to cruſh thee <hi>in pieces,</hi> with the leaſt effects of his wrath? <hi>Did ever man or woman harden themſelves againſt God, and proſpered?</hi> And is there <hi>no hurt</hi> in that which ſtirreth up his fury againſt thy Soul? <hi>Do you provoke him to anger, and do not you provoke your ſelves, to the confuſion of your own faces? Jer.</hi> 7.19. Why <hi>man,</hi> Gods wrath is incenſed, by the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> of thine abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. See what order he gave in caſe of the profanation of the Sabbath, when the man gathered ſticks in the wilderneſs on that day. <hi>Num.</hi> 15.35. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Moſes, the man ſhall be ſurely put to death, all the congregation ſhall ſtone him with ſtones, without the camp.</hi> See how Jealous he was, in the caſe of his <hi>inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> When <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> Prieſts whom the Lord had <hi>conſecrated,</hi> offered up <hi>incenſe</hi> before
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106335:121"/>him. They were ingaged in the ſervice of the <hi>true God,</hi> and in the duties, <hi>for the main,</hi> of his own <hi>appointment:</hi> Only they took liberty to make uſe of <hi>ſtrange fire, which God had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.</hi> Lev. 10.2. Obſerve how ſeverely he dealt in the caſe of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> who did but touch the <hi>ark,</hi> when the <hi>Oxen</hi> ſhook it; <hi>probably</hi> out of a good intention. <hi>And the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Uzzah, <hi>and he ſmote him, becauſe he put his hand to the Ark: and there he died before God,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.10. Laſtly, mind what dreadful <hi>comminations</hi> are denounced againſt the <hi>ſmalleſt preſumptuous</hi> ſins, (ſuch as thine are, for which thou pleadeſt, as having no hurt in them.) <hi>Num.</hi> 15.30, 31. <hi>But the Soul that doth ought preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, whether he be born in the land, or a ſtranger, the ſame reproacheth the Lord: and that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among his people. Becauſe he hath deſpiſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandment: that ſoul ſhall utterly be cut off: his iniquity ſhall be upon him.</hi> Mark it, the leaſt preſumptuous ſin is a reproaching of God, and <hi>deſpiſing</hi> his word. It reproacheth God <hi>as a lyar,</hi> as if he would not make good his threatnings: It reproacheth him, <hi>as a countenancer of wickedneſs: As unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous</hi> in his doings: and it expoſeth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be <hi>utterly cut off,</hi> and to <hi>die</hi> in his ſins. <hi>And is there no hurt in ſuch things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>What apprehenſions are you likely to have of theſe impieties, at the day of accounts? Then,</hi> when conſcience is awakened, they will appear in their <hi>danger</hi> and <hi>loathſomneſs. Then,</hi> when puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106335:122"/>is at hand, your ſouls will rue it, <hi>that ever you medled with them:</hi> that ever you were ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, as to follow after <hi>lying vanities.</hi> For the day of Judgment will be a day of <hi>conviction,</hi> as well as of recompence, <hi>Jude</hi> 15. <hi>O my beloved,</hi> lay theſe things to heart <hi>betimes, whilſt you are yet in the way.</hi> It is a dreadful thing to be <hi>unconvinced</hi> of the bitterneſs of ſin, till the torments of hell <hi>convince</hi> you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>laſt principle</hi> of the <hi>multitude,</hi> which I ſhall mention, hath an eye upon the <hi>electing grace of God.</hi> Will they ſay, <hi>If God hath appointed to ſave us, we ſhall be ſaved; though we be never ſo great ſtrangers to the wayes of holineſs: And if he hath appointed us to wrath, we ſhall periſh; all our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and endeavours will be to no purpoſe, to withſtand or alter his counſels.</hi> Thus the Devil hath taught ungodly men to <hi>reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> are his <hi>Uſhers</hi> to inſtruct them more <hi>artificially</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this <hi>wretched principle.</hi> This is one of the <hi>ſtrong holds of Satan,</hi> whereby he keepes poſſeſſion of the ſouls of the <hi>unregenerate.</hi> By thus arguing, they remove all <hi>hindrances</hi> out of the way, that they may give themſelves up freely <hi>to laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to commit iniquity with greedineſs.</hi> It is the very <hi>principle</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth to be in the hearts of the impenitent, and which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes with ſuch <hi>vehemency</hi> and holy <hi>indignation, Rom.</hi> 9.18, 19. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt ſay then unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will.</hi> As if they ſhould ſay, our ſalvation, <hi>we ſee,</hi> depends wholly on the will and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106335:122"/>pleaſure of God; <hi>If he hath decreed to bring us to heaven, we ſhall get thither, however we demean our ſelves: and if God hath decreed us to condemnation, we ſhall be condemned, whatever pains we take to walk in the ſtrict wayes of religion.</hi> For his will is <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and unchangeable,</hi> ſuch as cannot be reſiſted.</p>
               <p>
